# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Autonomous Incident Commander is an AI-powered multi-agent system that provides zero-touch incident resolution for cloud infrastructure. The system uses coordinated agent swarms to detect, diagnose, predict, and resolve incidents autonomously, reducing mean time to resolution (MTTR) from 30+ minutes to under 3 minutes. The system targets enterprise DevOps and SRE teams struggling with alert fatigue, increasing incident complexity, skill gaps, and high incident costs.

> Operational thresholds (consensus weights, circuit breaker policy, notification rate limits, and agent SLAs) are defined centrally in _Steering → Architecture → Shared Operational Constants_ and should be referenced instead of redefining values in individual requirements.
