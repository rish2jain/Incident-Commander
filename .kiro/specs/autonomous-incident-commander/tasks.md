## Implementation Notes

### Task Dependencies

- Tasks must be completed in order within each section
- Cross-section dependencies are indicated by requirements references
- Core tasks are required for comprehensive system implementation; optional items (`*`) can follow once milestone objectives are satisfied
- Reuse canonical thresholds from _Steering → Architecture → Shared Operational Constants_ when configuring services or writing tests

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests focus on individual component functionality
- Integration tests validate multi-component workflows
- Chaos engineering tests validate resilience and fault tolerance
- Demo tests ensure presentation readiness and timing

### Security Considerations

- All tasks involving external integrations must implement proper authentication
- Data handling tasks must include encryption and PII protection
- Resolution tasks must include sandbox validation and audit logging
- Communication tasks must include rate limiting and content filtering

### Performance Requirements

- Detection tasks must handle 50K+ alert storms
- Diagnosis tasks must process 1TB+ log volumes
- RAG memory tasks must scale to 100K+ incident vectors
- System must support 1000+ concurrent incidents

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to building the Autonomous Incident Commander system with incremental progress, comprehensive testing, and production-ready security and scalability features. Enhanced with critical production gaps including message bus resilience, partition tolerance, emergency procedures, and compelling demo features for maximum judge appeal.
