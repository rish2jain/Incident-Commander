# Dashboard Backend Integration Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the complete transformation of the Incident Commander dashboard system from a single approach to a **strategic 3-dashboard architecture**: 2 polished demo dashboards for presentations and 1 production-ready dashboard with full AWS AI integration and live data streaming.

## Strategic Architecture Philosophy

**Dashboard 1 (/demo)** and **Dashboard 2 (/transparency)** are intentionally demo-focused with polished mock data for reliable presentations. **Dashboard 3 (/live)** is the production system with complete backend integration, all 8 AWS AI services, and real-time data streaming.

## Glossary

- **Dashboard_Demo_1**: Executive demo at `/demo` with business value focus and polished mock data
- **Dashboard_Demo_2**: Technical transparency demo at `/transparency` with AI explainability and simulated scenarios
- **Dashboard_Production**: Production monitoring at `/live` with real-time WebSocket, complete AWS integration, and live data only
- **Backend_System**: The Python FastAPI application with agent orchestration and AWS integrations
- **WebSocket_Connection**: Real-time bidirectional communication channel between Dashboard_Production and Backend_System
- **Agent_Orchestrator**: The multi-agent coordination system managing incident response workflow
- **AWS_AI_Services_8**: All 8 AWS AI services (Bedrock, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Q Business, Nova Micro/Lite/Pro, Strands SDK, Guardrails, Knowledge Bases, CloudWatch)
- **Mock_Data**: Hardcoded/simulated data in Dashboard_Demo_1 and Dashboard_Demo_2 for reliable presentations
- **Live_Data**: Real-time data streams from actual agent processing and AWS service responses in Dashboard_Production only
- **Production_System**: Fully deployed operational system on AWS infrastructure handling real incidents

## Dashboard Architecture Requirements

### Requirement 1: Three-Dashboard Strategic Separation

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want three distinct dashboard implementations optimized for different purposes, so that I can deliver polished demos while also building a production-ready system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing `/demo`, THE system SHALL serve Dashboard_Demo_1 with executive-focused business metrics using polished mock data
2. WHEN accessing `/transparency`, THE system SHALL serve Dashboard_Demo_2 with technical AI transparency using simulated scenarios
3. WHEN accessing `/live`, THE system SHALL serve Dashboard_Production with real-time monitoring using only live data from Backend_System
4. WHERE Dashboard_Demo_1 and Dashboard_Demo_2 operate, THE system SHALL NOT attempt WebSocket connections or backend API calls
5. WHERE Dashboard_Production operates, THE system SHALL NEVER display mock data and SHALL show "No Data" if backend connection fails

### Requirement 2: Dashboard Demo 1 - Executive Presentation (`/demo`)

**User Story:** As a judge or executive, I want a 3-5 minute polished presentation of business value, so that I can quickly understand the ROI and competitive advantages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Dashboard_Demo_1 loads, THE system SHALL display animated incident progression with 6-phase workflow visualization
2. WHEN presenting business metrics, THE system SHALL show ROI calculator, cost savings ($2.8M annual), and MTTR reduction (95.2%)
3. WHILE demonstrating capabilities, THE system SHALL showcase all 8 AWS AI services with visual badges and role descriptions
4. WHEN users interact, THE system SHALL provide playback controls (start, pause, speed) for demo progression
5. WHERE comparisons are shown, THE system SHALL display before/after metrics and industry benchmark comparisons

**AWS Service Integration Strategy (Visual Showcase - Offline Operation)**:
- **Mode**: Offline demo with AWS service showcase badges
- **Data**: Polished mock data for reliability
- **AWS Usage**: Visual representation only (no API calls during presentation)
- **Services Showcased**:
  - Amazon Bedrock: Multi-agent reasoning platform
  - Claude 3.5 Sonnet: Complex reasoning and analysis
  - Amazon Q Business: Natural language incident queries
  - Amazon Nova (Micro/Lite/Pro): Fast inference routing
  - Strands SDK: Agent memory and learning
  - Bedrock Guardrails: Safety validation
  - Bedrock Knowledge Bases: Historical incident patterns
  - CloudWatch: Telemetry and monitoring

**Rationale**: Dashboard_Demo_1 remains 100% offline for maximum reliability during executive presentations. AWS services are showcased visually to demonstrate architecture without introducing demo failure risk.

### Requirement 3: Dashboard Demo 2 - Technical Transparency (`/transparency`)

**User Story:** As a technical judge or engineer, I want a 10-15 minute deep-dive into AI decision-making with full explainability features, so that I can evaluate the system's technical sophistication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Dashboard_Demo_2 loads, THE system SHALL present scenario selection with pre-configured incident types (database, API, network)
2. WHEN scenarios execute, THE system SHALL display detailed agent reasoning with confidence scores, evidence lists, and decision trees
3. WHILE demonstrating AI transparency, THE system SHALL show 5 explainability views (reasoning, confidence, consensus, evidence, decisions)
4. WHEN showcasing AWS services, THE system SHALL attribute each reasoning step to the AWS service that generated it with "Generated by AWS AI" badges
5. WHERE Byzantine fault tolerance is demonstrated, THE system SHALL simulate agent failures and show weighted consensus recovery
6. IF demonstration scenarios are regenerated, THE system SHALL use actual AWS services to generate fresh content with real API responses

**AWS Service Integration Strategy (Hybrid: Real Generation + Cached Display)**:

- **Approach**: Simulate learning curves and memory visualization
- **Display**: Show "Simulated - Production uses Strands SDK" disclaimer

**Bedrock Guardrails**:
- **Reason**: Safety validation best demonstrated in production with real actions
- **Approach**: Simulate validation results for demo scenarios
- **Display**: Show "Simulated guardrail validation - Production uses Bedrock Guardrails"

**CloudWatch**:
- **Reason**: Requires real infrastructure telemetry
- **Approach**: Use realistic mock metrics
- **Display**: Show "Mock telemetry - Production ingests from CloudWatch"
