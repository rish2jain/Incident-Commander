# Implementation Plan

Convert the dashboard backend integration design into a series of prompts for a code-generation LLM that will implement each step with incremental progress. Make sure that each prompt builds on the previous prompts, and ends with wiring things together. There should be no hanging or orphaned code that isn't integrated into a previous step. Focus ONLY on tasks that involve writing, modifying, or testing code.

## Three-Dashboard Architecture Strategy

This implementation plan follows a strategic separation:

- **Dashboard 1 (`/demo`)**: Executive presentation - NO CHANGES (already complete)
- **Dashboard 2 (`/transparency`)**: Technical deep-dive - HYBRID approach (Phase 0) âœ… **COMPLETE**
- **Dashboard 3 (`/ops`)**: Production monitoring - FULL INTEGRATION (Phases 1-8) ðŸ”„ **IN PROGRESS**

**Key Principle**: Dashboards 1 & 2 do NOT connect to WebSocket. Only Dashboard 3 is production-integrated.

**Current Status**: Phase 0 complete, Phase 1 infrastructure partially complete (WebSocket manager, endpoints, and hooks exist).
