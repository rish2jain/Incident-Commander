# Requirements Document - Dashboard Consolidation

## Introduction

This specification documents the consolidation of 7+ fragmented dashboards into 3 specialized, purpose-driven dashboards with a shared design system. Completed October 21, 2025.

## Glossary

- **Power_Demo**: Executive presentation dashboard with live incident animation (`/demo`)
- **Transparency_Dashboard**: AI explainability dashboard for technical deep-dives (`/transparency`)
- **Operations_Dashboard**: Production-ready WebSocket dashboard for real operations (`/ops`)
- **Design_Tokens**: Centralized design system with colors, spacing, and typography (`/src/lib/design-tokens.ts`)
- **Deprecated_Dashboards**: Archived dashboards consolidated into the 3 main dashboards
- **WebSocket_Integration**: Real-time backend communication for production operations
- **Live_Animation**: Step-by-step incident progression with playback controls

## Requirements

1. ✅ THE Transparency_Dashboard SHALL merge features from insights-demo and enhanced-insights-demo
2. ✅ THE System SHALL provide 5 transparency tabs (Reasoning, Decisions, Confidence, Communication, Analytics)
3. ✅ THE Transparency_Dashboard SHALL support 4 predefined scenarios + custom input
4. ✅ THE System SHALL visualize agent reasoning with evidence, alternatives, and risk assessment
5. ✅ THE Transparency_Dashboard SHALL include decision tree visualization

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

### Requirement 5: Enhance Power Demo for Hackathon

**User Story:** As a demo presenter, I want a comprehensive executive dashboard, so that I can deliver a 3-minute compelling presentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ THE Power_Demo SHALL include live incident animation with 6-step progression
2. ✅ THE System SHALL provide playback controls (Start, Pause, Restart, Skip, Speed)
3. ✅ THE Power_Demo SHALL display business impact calculator with real ROI calculations
4. ✅ THE System SHALL show before/after comparison (manual vs AI resolution)
5. ✅ THE Power_Demo SHALL include industry firsts and predicted incidents sections

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
- `/demo` route (renamed from /power-demo) with PowerDashboard
- Live animation: Detection → Diagnosis → Prediction → Consensus → Resolution → Validation
- Playback controls: ▶️ Start, ⏸️ Pause, ⏮️ Restart, ⏭️ Skip, Speed (1x/2x/4x)
- Business impact: $277K saved per incident, 91% faster
- Before/after: 30min vs 2.5min comparison

---

### Requirement 6: Archive Deprecated Dashboards

**User Story:** As a repository maintainer, I want deprecated dashboards archived, so that the codebase remains clean without losing historical reference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ DEPRECATED dashboard files SHALL be moved to `/archive/deprecated-dashboards/`
2. ✅ THE Archive directory SHALL include a README explaining why files were deprecated
3. ✅ THE Archive README SHALL provide migration paths to new dashboards
4. ✅ WHERE old dashboards had unique features, THE README SHALL document which new dashboard includes them
5. ✅ THE System SHALL NOT include deprecated dashboards in the build process

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
- HTML dashboards archived to `/archive/deprecated-dashboards/`
- Archive README created with full migration guide
- Deprecated routes removed from Next.js build
