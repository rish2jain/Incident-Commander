# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical user experience improvements for the Autonomous Incident Commander dashboard. The current dashboard provides real-time visualization of multi-agent incident response, but lacks key UX features that would improve usability during demonstrations and operational use. Specifically, the left-hand activity feed does not auto-scroll to show the latest messages, and there is no clear visual indication when incidents have been completely resolved. These improvements will enhance the demo experience for judges and provide better operational visibility for system operators.

## Glossary

- **Dashboard**: The web-based real-time visualization interface for the Autonomous Incident Commander system
- **Activity_Feed**: The left-hand panel that displays chronological incident events and agent communications
- **Incident_Status_Indicator**: Visual component that clearly shows the current state and completion status of incidents
- **Auto_Scroll_Manager**: Component responsible for automatically scrolling the activity feed to show latest content
- **Resolution_Notification**: Visual and/or audio notification system that indicates when incidents are fully resolved
- **WebSocket_Handler**: Component that manages real-time data updates from the backend system
- **Status_Timeline**: Visual representation of incident progression from detection through resolution

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a demo judge, I want the activity feed to automatically scroll to show the latest messages, so that I can follow the incident response progress without manual scrolling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new messages arrive in the activity feed, THE Auto_Scroll_Manager SHALL automatically scroll to the bottom to display the latest content
2. WHEN a user manually scrolls up to view historical messages, THE Auto_Scroll_Manager SHALL pause auto-scrolling to prevent interrupting user navigation
3. WHEN a user scrolls back to the bottom of the feed, THE Auto_Scroll_Manager SHALL resume automatic scrolling for new messages
4. WHERE the activity feed contains more than 50 messages, THE Auto_Scroll_Manager SHALL maintain smooth scrolling performance without lag
5. THE Auto_Scroll_Manager SHALL provide a visual indicator when auto-scroll is paused and offer a "scroll to latest" button

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want clear visual indication when incidents are completely resolved, so that I can quickly understand the current system status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an incident reaches full resolution, THE Incident_Status_Indicator SHALL display a prominent "RESOLVED" status with green coloring
2. WHEN incident resolution is complete, THE Dashboard SHALL show the total resolution time and final status summary
3. WHILE incidents are in progress, THE Incident_Status_Indicator SHALL show clear progress indicators for each resolution phase
4. WHERE multiple incidents are active, THE Dashboard SHALL provide an overview panel showing resolved vs active incident counts
5. THE Dashboard SHALL maintain resolved incident status for at least 30 seconds before transitioning to a summary view

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a demo presenter, I want enhanced visual feedback for incident lifecycle events, so that demonstrations are more engaging and easier to follow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN incidents transition between phases (detection, diagnosis, resolution), THE Dashboard SHALL provide smooth visual transitions with clear state changes
2. WHEN agents complete their tasks, THE Dashboard SHALL show completion animations and success indicators
3. WHILE incidents are being processed, THE Status_Timeline SHALL display real-time progress with estimated completion times
4. WHERE conflicts occur between agents, THE Dashboard SHALL highlight consensus resolution processes visually
5. THE Dashboard SHALL provide audio notifications (optional/configurable) for major incident lifecycle events

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the dashboard to handle connection issues gracefully, so that temporary network problems don't disrupt the user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WebSocket connections are lost, THE Dashboard SHALL display a connection status indicator and attempt automatic reconnection
2. WHEN reconnection succeeds, THE Dashboard SHALL synchronize with the latest system state without requiring page refresh
3. WHILE disconnected, THE Dashboard SHALL queue user interactions and replay them upon reconnection where appropriate
4. WHERE connection issues persist, THE Dashboard SHALL provide manual refresh options and fallback to polling mode
5. THE Dashboard SHALL maintain local state during brief disconnections to prevent data loss or UI flickering

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the dashboard improvements to handle high-frequency updates efficiently, so that the interface remains responsive during intense incident activity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Auto_Scroll_Manager SHALL handle rapid message bursts (100+ messages/second) without performance degradation
2. THE Incident_Status_Indicator SHALL update correctly during simulated network latency and connection drops
3. WHERE multiple browser tabs are open, THE Dashboard SHALL synchronize state across all instances
4. THE Dashboard SHALL maintain smooth animations and transitions even with frequent WebSocket updates
5. THE Dashboard SHALL implement efficient DOM updates to prevent memory leaks during long-running sessions
