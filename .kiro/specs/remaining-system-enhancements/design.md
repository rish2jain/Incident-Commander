```python
@dataclass
class IntegrationStatus:
    amazon_q: ServiceStatus
    nova_act: ServiceStatus
    strands_sdk: ServiceStatus
    titan_embeddings: ServiceStatus
    bedrock_agents: ServiceStatus

    response_time: float
    error_rate: float
    last_health_check: datetime
    diagnostic_info: Optional[DiagnosticInfo]
```

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation Strategy

The enhanced system implements comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation:

```python
class EnhancementErrorHandler:
    async def handle_showcase_failure(self, error: Exception) -> PartialShowcaseResponse:
        """Provide partial showcase when some services are unavailable"""

    async def handle_deployment_failure(self, error: DeploymentError) -> RecoveryPlan:
        """Generate recovery plan for deployment failures"""

    async def handle_visualization_error(self, error: VisualizationError) -> FallbackDisplay:
        """Provide fallback visualization when 3D rendering fails"""
```

**Error Handling Principles**:

- Never fail completely - always provide partial functionality
- Clear error reporting with actionable recovery steps
- Automatic fallback to simpler alternatives
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and improvement
- User-friendly error messages for demo scenarios

### Resilience Patterns

1. **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascade failures in integration calls
2. **Retry with Backoff**: Handle transient failures gracefully
3. **Bulkhead**: Isolate failures to prevent system-wide impact
4. **Timeout**: Prevent hanging operations during demos
5. **Fallback**: Provide alternative responses when services are unavailable

## Testing Strategy

### Comprehensive Testing Approach

The testing strategy covers all enhancement areas with automated validation:

#### 1. Showcase Endpoint Testing

```python
class TestShowcaseController:
    async def test_full_showcase_generation(self):

        """Test showcase with some services unavailable"""

    async def test_performance_under_load(self):
        """Test showcase performance with concurrent requests"""
```

#### 2. Deployment Pipeline Testing

```python
class TestDeploymentPipeline:
    async def test_staging_deployment(self):
        """Test complete staging environment deployment"""

    async def test_rollback_procedures(self):
        """Test deployment rollback functionality"""

    async def test_configuration_validation(self):
        """Test service configuration validation"""
```

```

### Performance Testing

**Load Testing Scenarios**:

- High-frequency visualization updates (60fps sustained)
- Deployment pipeline under multiple environment requests
- Chaos testing with production-level load

**Performance Targets**:

- Deployment pipeline: <10 minutes for complete environment
- Integration monitoring: <5 seconds for health checks

### Demo Validation Testing

**Demo Scenario Testing**:

- Judge interaction workflows
- Failure recovery demonstrations
- Performance metric showcases
- Business impact calculations

**Acceptance Criteria Validation**:

- All requirements must pass automated tests
- Performance targets must be consistently met
- Error handling must provide graceful degradation
- Documentation must be automatically generated and validated

## Implementation Considerations

### Development Approach

1. **Incremental Enhancement**: Build on existing 98% complete system
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure existing functionality remains intact
3. **Modular Design**: Each enhancement can be developed and deployed independently
4. **Performance First**: Optimize for demo performance and judge experience
5. **Production Ready**: All enhancements must meet production quality standards

### Integration Strategy

1. **Existing API Compatibility**: Maintain all existing endpoints
2. **WebSocket Enhancement**: Extend existing WebSocket for 3D visualization
3. **Database Schema**: Extend existing tables without breaking changes
4. **Configuration Management**: Use existing environment variable patterns
5. **Monitoring Integration**: Leverage existing observability infrastructure

### Deployment Considerations

1. **Zero Downtime**: All enhancements must support rolling deployment
2. **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags for gradual rollout
3. **Rollback Safety**: All changes must be safely reversible
4. **Environment Parity**: Ensure consistency across dev/staging/production
5. **Security Compliance**: Maintain existing security standards and practices
