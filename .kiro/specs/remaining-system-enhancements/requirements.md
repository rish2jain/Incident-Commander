# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers the implementation of remaining high-priority enhancements for the Autonomous Incident Commander system. The system is currently 98% complete with all core functionality operational, but several enhancements would maximize prize eligibility, improve demo presentation, and ensure production deployment readiness. These enhancements focus on visual improvements, deployment automation, and comprehensive integration showcase capabilities.

## Glossary

- **System**: The Autonomous Incident Commander multi-agent system
- **Demo_Controller**: The interactive demonstration management service
- **Showcase_Route**: A unified API endpoint that demonstrates all system capabilities
- **Deployment_Pipeline**: Automated infrastructure deployment and configuration process
- **Visual_Dashboard**: The 3D real-time visualization interface
- **Integration_Validator**: Service that validates all AWS service integrations are operational

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a hackathon judge, I want a single comprehensive demonstration endpoint, so that I can quickly evaluate all system capabilities in one request.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a judge accesses the showcase endpoint, THE System SHALL return a unified response containing all major capabilities
2. THE System SHALL include Amazon Q analysis, Nova Act planning, Strands coordination metrics, and business impact calculations in the showcase response
3. THE System SHALL complete the showcase demonstration within 30 seconds
4. THE System SHALL provide fallback responses when individual services are unavailable
5. THE System SHALL log all showcase requests for analytics and performance monitoring

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated deployment to staging and production environments, so that I can deploy the system reliably without manual configuration steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment is initiated, THE System SHALL automatically provision all required AWS resources using CDK
2. THE System SHALL configure Bedrock agents with proper IAM roles and permissions
3. THE System SHALL validate all service integrations after deployment completion
4. IF deployment fails, THEN THE System SHALL provide detailed error reporting and rollback capabilities
5. THE System SHALL support deployment to multiple environments (staging, production) with environment-specific configurations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a demo presenter, I want enhanced 3D visualization capabilities, so that I can provide compelling visual demonstrations of the multi-agent system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL display real-time 3D visualization of agent interactions and coordination
2. WHEN agents communicate, THE System SHALL show visual connections and data flow between agents
3. THE System SHALL animate agent state changes (idle, processing, collaborating) in real-time
4. THE System SHALL provide interactive controls for demo scenarios within the 3D interface
5. THE System SHALL maintain smooth 60fps performance during live demonstrations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want comprehensive ROI and business impact reporting, so that I can understand the financial value and competitive advantages of the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL calculate industry-specific ROI projections for different business verticals
2. THE System SHALL provide real-time cost savings analysis during incident resolution
3. THE System SHALL generate executive-level business impact reports with concrete metrics
4. THE System SHALL compare performance against traditional incident response approaches
5. THE System SHALL export business impact data in multiple formats (PDF, Excel, JSON)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive monitoring and observability, so that I can ensure all integrations are functioning correctly and identify performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL provide real-time health monitoring for all AWS service integrations
2. THE System SHALL track and report guardrail decisions and policy enforcement
3. THE System SHALL monitor agent performance metrics and execution statistics
4. WHEN integration failures occur, THE System SHALL provide detailed diagnostic information
5. THE System SHALL maintain historical performance data for trend analysis

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a development team member, I want comprehensive chaos engineering validation, so that I can ensure the system maintains resilience under various failure conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL execute automated chaos engineering tests covering network, database, and service failures
2. THE System SHALL validate recovery procedures and measure recovery time objectives
3. THE System SHALL simulate Byzantine node failures and verify consensus mechanisms
4. THE System SHALL test connection pool exhaustion and memory leak scenarios
5. THE System SHALL generate comprehensive resilience reports with performance baselines

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want automated documentation generation, so that I can maintain up-to-date system documentation and training materials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL automatically generate runbook updates based on incident resolution patterns
2. THE System SHALL create knowledge base articles from successful incident resolutions
3. THE System SHALL generate interactive troubleshooting guides using Amazon Q integration
4. THE System SHALL produce post-incident documentation automatically
5. THE System SHALL maintain version control and change tracking for all generated documentation

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want intelligent model routing and cost optimization, so that I can balance response time, accuracy, and operational costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL route requests to appropriate models based on latency and cost requirements
2. WHEN speed is prioritized, THE System SHALL use Haiku models for faster response times
3. WHEN accuracy is prioritized, THE System SHALL use Sonnet models for complex analysis
4. THE System SHALL track and optimize model usage costs across all agents
5. THE System SHALL provide cost analysis and optimization recommendations
