# Product Overview

## Autonomous Incident Commander

An AI-powered multi-agent system that provides zero-touch incident resolution for cloud infrastructure. The system uses coordinated agent swarms to detect, diagnose, and resolve incidents autonomously, reducing mean time to resolution (MTTR) from 30+ minutes to under 3 minutes.

### Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Specialized agents (Detection, Diagnosis, Prediction, Resolution) work together using swarm intelligence
- **Zero-Touch Resolution**: Autonomous incident handling with optional human approval gates for high-stakes changes
- **Predictive Prevention**: Agents predict and prevent incidents 15-30 minutes before they occur
- **Self-Improving Architecture**: Agents learn from incidents and update their own workflows using RAG-powered learning
- **Cross-Cloud Support**: Native multi-cloud incident response (AWS, Azure, GCP)

### Target Market

Enterprise DevOps and SRE teams struggling with:

- Alert fatigue (10,000+ daily alerts)
- Increasing incident complexity
- Skill gaps in incident response
- High incident costs ($800K+ per major incident)

### Competitive Advantage

First truly autonomous incident response system with multi-agent coordination, compared to existing single-agent or rule-based solutions (PagerDuty Advance, ServiceNow NowAssist, Splunk SOAR).
