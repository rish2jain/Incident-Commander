# Design Patterns & Guidelines

## Core Design Patterns

### 1. Multi-Agent System
All agents inherit from `BaseAgent` interface in `src/interfaces/agent.py`:
- **Detection Agent**: Alert correlation, incident detection
- **Diagnosis Agent**: Root cause analysis, log investigation
- **Prediction Agent**: Trend forecasting, risk assessment
- **Resolution Agent**: Automated remediation with sandbox validation
- **Communication Agent**: Stakeholder notifications, escalation

### 2. Event Sourcing
- All state changes flow through event store
- Kinesis for streaming, DynamoDB for persistence
- Event integrity verification with cryptographic hashing
- Optimistic locking for concurrent updates
- Cross-region disaster recovery

### 3. Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Implemented for ALL external service calls
- Three states: CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN
- Configurable thresholds and timeouts
- Agent-level circuit breakers with health monitoring
- Service-level circuit breakers (Bedrock, Slack, PagerDuty, Datadog)

### 4. Byzantine Fault-Tolerant Consensus
- Ensures reliable multi-agent decision making
- Voting-based consensus with confidence thresholds
- Handles malicious/faulty agent responses
- Human approval required for low confidence (<0.7)

### 5. Defensive Programming
- **Bounds Checking**: All collections have max size limits
- **Timeout Protection**: All operations have configurable timeouts
- **Input Validation**: Pydantic models for all inputs
- **Memory Pressure Management**: 80% threshold with emergency cleanup
- **Circular Reference Detection**: Prevent infinite loops in correlation

## Performance Targets & Constraints

### Agent Processing Targets
| Agent | Target | Max | Current |
|-------|--------|-----|---------|
| Detection | 30s | 60s | <1s ✅ |
| Diagnosis | 120s | 180s | <1s ✅ |
| Prediction | 90s | 150s | TBD |
| Resolution | 180s | 300s | TBD |
| Communication | 10s | 30s | TBD |

### System Constraints
- **Alert Storm Handling**: 100 alerts/sec with priority sampling
- **Log Analysis**: 100MB limit with intelligent sampling
- **Correlation Depth**: Max depth 5 to prevent runaway analysis
- **Memory Threshold**: 80% with emergency cleanup
- **Embedding Cache**: Performance optimization for RAG

## Security Guidelines

### Zero Trust Architecture
- Never trust, always verify
- Validate all inputs with Pydantic
- Sanitize all external data
- Audit log all sensitive operations

### IAM & Access Control
- IAM role assumption with least privilege
- 12-hour credential rotation
- No hardcoded credentials
- Environment variables for secrets

### Cryptographic Integrity
- Event integrity verification with SHA-256
- Audit trail with cryptographic hashing
- Tamper detection and corruption recovery

## Error Handling Strategy

### Custom Exception Hierarchy
All exceptions inherit from `IncidentCommanderError` in `src/utils/exceptions.py`:
- `ConfigurationError` - Invalid configuration
- `EventStoreError` - Event persistence failures
- `ConsensusError` - Consensus failures
- `CircuitBreakerError` - Circuit breaker trips
- `AgentExecutionError` - Agent processing failures

### Logging Standards
- Structured logging with `structlog`
- Correlation IDs for request tracing
- JSON formatting for machine parsing
- Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL

### Graceful Degradation
- Circuit breakers prevent cascade failures
- Rate limiters protect external services
- Fallback mechanisms for all critical paths
- Health checks for early failure detection

## RAG Memory System

### OpenSearch Serverless Integration
- Hierarchical indexing for 100K+ incident patterns
- Bedrock Titan embeddings (1536 dimensions)
- Similarity search for pattern matching
- Embedding caching for performance

### Pattern Storage
- Store successful resolution patterns
- Similarity-based retrieval
- Confidence scoring for recommendations
- Historical pattern learning

## API Design Principles

### RESTful Conventions
- Use HTTP verbs correctly (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Plural resource names (`/incidents`, `/agents`)
- Versioning in URL path if needed
- Status codes: 200 OK, 201 Created, 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Error

### Response Format
- Consistent JSON structure
- Include timestamps in ISO 8601 format
- Provide correlation IDs for debugging
- Include business impact metrics

## Testing Strategy

### Test Organization
- **Unit Tests**: `tests/unit/` - Individual component testing
- **Integration Tests**: `tests/integration/` - End-to-end flows
- **Chaos Tests**: `tests/chaos/` - Fault injection scenarios
- **Load Tests**: `tests/load/` - Performance validation

### Test Fixtures
Located in `tests/conftest.py`:
- Slack stubs for communication testing
- Bedrock stubs for agent reasoning
- LocalStack stubs for AWS services
- Mock data for incident scenarios

### Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 80% statement coverage
- Critical paths require 100% coverage
- Edge cases explicitly tested
- Regression tests for all bug fixes

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- `main` - Production-ready code
- Feature branches: `feature/<feature-name>`
- Never commit directly to main

### Commit Conventions
Use Conventional Commits format:
- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `infra:` - Infrastructure updates
- `test:` - Test additions/updates
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring

### Code Review Guidelines
- Reference incident IDs or steering docs
- Include testing evidence
- Request reviews from relevant domain owners
- Ensure all quality checks pass before review
