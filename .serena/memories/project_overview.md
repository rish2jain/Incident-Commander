# Incident Commander - Project Overview

## Purpose
An AI-powered multi-agent system providing zero-touch incident resolution for cloud infrastructure. The system uses coordinated agent swarms to detect, diagnose, and resolve incidents autonomously, reducing MTTR from 30+ minutes to under 3 minutes.

## Core Capabilities
- **Multi-Agent System**: Specialized agents for Detection, Diagnosis, Prediction, Resolution, and Communication
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Kinesis + DynamoDB for incident state management
- **Byzantine Fault-Tolerant Consensus**: Ensures reliable decision making across agents
- **Circuit Breakers**: Resilient inter-agent communication with fault isolation
- **RAG Memory System**: OpenSearch Serverless for historical pattern matching (100K+ incidents)

## Current Status
**Milestone 1 COMPLETE** (MVP Foundations)
- âœ… Foundation infrastructure and core interfaces
- âœ… Event store and state management
- âœ… Circuit breaker and rate limiting
- âœ… Detection and Diagnosis agents implemented
- âœ… RAG memory system with OpenSearch Serverless

**Next: Milestone 2** - Production Hardening (Prediction, Resolution, Communication agents)

## Agent Types & Status
1. **Detection Agent** âœ… - Alert correlation and incident detection (<1s, target 30s)
2. **Diagnosis Agent** âœ… - Root cause analysis and log investigation (<1s, target 120s)
3. **Prediction Agent** ðŸ”„ - Trend forecasting and risk assessment (target 90s)
4. **Resolution Agent** ðŸ”„ - Automated remediation actions (target 180s)
5. **Communication Agent** ðŸ”„ - Stakeholder notifications (target 10s)

## Business Impact
- Tier 1 incidents: $3,800/minute with 2000 users
- Service tier based cost calculations
- Automatic business impact assessment
