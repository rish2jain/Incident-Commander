## Overview

The enhanced demo recording system has been optimized for a focused 3-minute demonstration that captures all key competitive advantages and business value propositions within the optimal attention span for hackathon judges.

## ⏱️ Timing Optimization

### Total Duration: ~3.3 minutes

- **Core Scenarios**: 170 seconds (2.8 minutes)
- **Pauses & Overhead**: 30 seconds
- **Total Recording**: ~200 seconds (3.3 minutes)

### Scenario Breakdown:

1. **Homepage** (15s) - System architecture overview
2. **PowerDashboard** (45s) - Business metrics and ROI demonstration
3. **AI Transparency** (60s) - Complete explainability system
4. **Operations** (30s) - Production monitoring
5. **AWS AI Showcase** (20s) - Complete service integration

## 🎯 Optimizations Made

### Reduced Scenario Durations:

- **Homepage**: 20s → 15s (removed navigation highlighting)
- **PowerDashboard**: 60s → 45s (streamlined to core metrics)
- **Transparency**: 80s → 60s (focused on key tabs only)
- **Operations**: 40s → 30s (essential monitoring only)
- **AWS AI Showcase**: 30s → 20s (core integration proof)

### Streamlined Actions:

- **Homepage**: Removed `highlight_navigation` action
- **PowerDashboard**: Removed `demonstrate_roi` action
- **Transparency**: Removed `demonstrate_consensus` action
- **Operations**: Removed `monitor_agents` action
- **AWS AI Showcase**: Removed `demonstrate_integration` action

### Optimized Wait Times:

- **General wait**: 3s → 2s
- **Demo triggers**: 6s → 4s
- **Tab navigation**: 3s → 2s
- **Action pauses**: 2s → 1.5s
- **Scenario transitions**: 3s → 2s
