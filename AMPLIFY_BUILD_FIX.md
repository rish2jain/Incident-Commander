# Amplify Build Fix Applied

## Problem Identified

The Amplify build failed because:
1. **Missing package-lock.json**: `npm ci` couldn't find the lockfile at repository root
2. **Wrong directory context**: Build commands were running at repo root instead of `dashboard/` subdirectory

### Error from logs:
```
npm error The `npm ci` command can only install with an existing package-lock.json
npm error Clean install a project
```

## Solution Applied

**Created root-level `amplify.yml`** with explicit path references:

```yaml
version: 1
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - cd dashboard        # âœ… Changed to dashboard directory
        - npm ci
    build:
      commands:
        - npm run build
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: dashboard/.next  # âœ… Updated path
    files:
      - "**/*"
  cache:
    paths:
      - dashboard/node_modules/**/*     # âœ… Updated path
      - dashboard/.next/cache/**/*      # âœ… Updated path
```

## Changes Made

1. **Root amplify.yml created**: [/amplify.yml](amplify.yml)
2. **Git commit**: `b952ec42` - "fix: Move amplify.yml to root with dashboard/ path references"
3. **Pushed to GitHub**: Main branch updated
4. **Automatic rebuild triggered**: Amplify will detect the new amplify.yml and rebuild

## Expected Build Flow

```
1. Clone repo â†’ /codebuild/.../Incident-Commander/
2. Read amplify.yml from root âœ…
3. cd dashboard âœ…
4. npm ci â†’ finds package-lock.json âœ…
5. npm run build â†’ builds Next.js âœ…
6. Deploy dashboard/.next â†’ Amplify hosting âœ…
```

## Deployment Status

### AWS CDK Infrastructure
âœ… **All stacks deployed successfully**:
- IncidentCommanderCore-development
- IncidentCommanderNetworking-development
- IncidentCommanderSecurity-development
- IncidentCommanderDashboard-development

### CloudFront Distribution
âœ… **Operational**: https://d2j5829zuijr97.cloudfront.net
- Distribution ID: E1XX6CA7ZZU5V9
- S3 Bucket: incident-commander-dashboard-development

### AWS Amplify
ðŸ”„ **Rebuilding with fix**: https://main.d1o5cfrpl0kgt3.amplifyapp.com
- App ID: d1o5cfrpl0kgt3
- Branch: main
- Status: Build triggered automatically via GitHub push

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Amplify build** in AWS Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home?region=us-east-1#/d1o5cfrpl0kgt3
2. **Build should complete in 3-5 minutes**
3. **Verify dashboard is live** at https://main.d1o5cfrpl0kgt3.amplifyapp.com
4. **Test interactive features**: 3D visualizations, WebSocket connectivity, real-time updates

## Verification Checklist

Once build completes, verify:
- [ ] Dashboard loads at Amplify URL
- [ ] 3D incident visualization renders
- [ ] WebSocket connection establishes
- [ ] Real-time metrics update
- [ ] Byzantine fault tolerance indicators functional
- [ ] AI transparency controls responsive
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness working

## Troubleshooting

If build still fails:
1. Check build logs in Amplify Console
2. Verify `dashboard/package-lock.json` exists in GitHub repo
3. Ensure Node.js version compatibility (using default Amplify Node.js)
4. Check for any TypeScript compilation errors
