2. **Transparency Dashboard** (`/transparency`) - Engineering/technical view

   - AI decision-making process visibility
   - Agent consensus and confidence scores
   - Technical implementation details
   - LangGraph state visualization (planned)

3. **Operations Dashboard** (`/ops`) - Production monitoring view
   - Real-time system health
   - Live incident tracking
   - Operational metrics and alerts
   - Distributed service monitoring

### Technical Implementation

- **Next.js 14** with App Router
- **React 18** with modern hooks
- **WebSocket** real-time updates
- **Tailwind CSS** with glassmorphism design
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Framer Motion** for animations
