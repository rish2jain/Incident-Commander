# AWS Deployment Challenges - Incident Commander

## Overview

This document outlines the challenges encountered while deploying the Incident Commander dashboard and system components to AWS for judge access during the hackathon evaluation.

## Current Deployment Status

### ‚úÖ Successfully Deployed Components

1. **AWS Infrastructure (CDK)**

   - 7 CDK stacks deployed successfully
   - DynamoDB tables (3 tables operational)
   - EventBridge rules (3 rules configured)
   - IAM roles (2 roles created)
   - Bedrock agents (4 agents created)
   - CloudWatch monitoring (4 dashboards, 21 metrics, 4 alarms)

2. **API Gateway**

   - Production endpoint: `https://2bz10q7hc3.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`
   - Basic API structure deployed

3. **Local Development Environment**
   - Backend API running on `http://localhost:8000`
   - Next.js dashboard running on `http://localhost:3000`
   - All AWS AI services integrated and operational

## üö® Current Challenges

### 1. S3 Static Website Hosting - Access Denied

**Issue**: S3 bucket public access policies are blocked at the account level.

```bash
Error: User: arn:aws:iam::294337990007:root is not authorized to perform: s3:PutBucketPolicy
on resource: "arn:aws:s3:::incident-commander-dashboard-judges" because public policies are
blocked by the BlockPublicPolicy block public access setting.
```

**Impact**:

- Cannot deploy dashboard as static website to S3
- Judges cannot access dashboard via S3 website URL
- S3 website URL returns 403 Forbidden

**Attempted Solutions**:

- ‚ùå Direct S3 public bucket policy
- ‚ùå S3 website hosting with public access
- üîÑ CloudFront with Origin Access Control (in progress)

### 2. Lambda Function Update Restrictions

**Issue**: Cannot update existing Lambda function code programmatically.

```bash
Error: The command was not executed due to an error: This operation was aborted
```

**Impact**:

- Cannot add dashboard endpoint to existing API Gateway
- Dashboard cannot be served through the same API endpoint
- Judges must use separate URLs for API and dashboard

**Root Cause**:

- Lambda function may be managed by CDK/CloudFormation
- Direct updates conflict with infrastructure-as-code management
- Permissions may be restricted for function code updates

### 3. API Gateway Integration Gap

**Issue**: API Gateway endpoints exist but don't serve the dashboard.

**Current State**:

- API Gateway URL: `https://2bz10q7hc3.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`
- Health endpoint returns: `{"message":"Not Found"}`
- No dashboard endpoint available

**Impact**:

- Judges cannot access interactive dashboard remotely
- Only local development environment is fully functional
- API endpoints are not properly connected to Lambda functions

### 4. Account-Level Security Restrictions

**Issue**: AWS account has restrictive security policies that prevent standard deployment patterns.

**Restrictions Identified**:

- S3 public access blocked globally
- Lambda function updates restricted
- Bucket policies cannot be applied

**Impact**:

- Standard static website hosting patterns don't work
- Need alternative deployment strategies
- Increased complexity for simple dashboard deployment

## üîß Workarounds Implemented

### 1. Local Development Environment

**Status**: ‚úÖ Fully Operational

```bash
# Backend API
http://localhost:8000
- Health check: ‚úÖ Working
- Demo stats: ‚úÖ Working
- AWS AI integration: ‚úÖ Working
- All endpoints: ‚úÖ Working

# Frontend Dashboard
http://localhost:3000
- PowerDashboard: ‚úÖ Working
- AI Transparency: ‚úÖ Working
- Operations View: ‚úÖ Working
- Real-time updates: ‚úÖ Working
```

### 2. API-Only Access

**Status**: ‚úÖ Partially Working

```bash
# Live AWS API endpoints (some working)
curl https://2bz10q7hc3.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/health
# Returns: {"message":"Not Found"}

# Local API endpoints (fully working)
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# Returns: Full health status with all services
```

### 3. Static Dashboard Creation

**Status**: ‚úÖ Created, ‚ùå Not Accessible

- Created professional static dashboard HTML
- Uploaded to S3 bucket
- Cannot be accessed due to public access restrictions

## üìã Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: CloudFront Distribution (Recommended)

**Approach**: Use CloudFront with Origin Access Control to serve S3 content

**Advantages**:

- Bypasses S3 public access restrictions
- Provides global CDN
- Professional deployment pattern

**Status**: üîÑ In Development

**Implementation**:

```python
# Create CloudFront distribution with OAC
# Update S3 bucket policy for CloudFront service principal
# Deploy dashboard through CDK stack
```

### Option 2: API Gateway HTML Response

**Approach**: Serve dashboard HTML directly from API Gateway Lambda

**Advantages**:

- Uses existing API Gateway endpoint
- Single URL for judges
- No additional infrastructure needed

**Status**: üîÑ Blocked by Lambda update restrictions

**Implementation**:

```python
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    if event['path'] == '/dashboard':
        return {
            'statusCode': 200,
            'headers': {'Content-Type': 'text/html'},
            'body': dashboard_html
        }
```

### Option 3: AWS Amplify Hosting

**Approach**: Deploy Next.js app to AWS Amplify

**Advantages**:

- Designed for frontend applications
- Automatic CI/CD
- Custom domain support

**Status**: üîÑ Not Yet Attempted

**Requirements**:

- GitHub repository connection
- Build configuration
- Environment variables setup

### Option 4: ECS/Fargate Container Deployment

**Approach**: Deploy full application stack as containers

**Advantages**:

- Complete application deployment
- Scalable and production-ready
- Full control over environment

**Status**: üîÑ Complex, time-intensive

## üéØ Recommended Immediate Actions

### For Judge Evaluation

1. **Primary**: Use local development environment

   ```bash
   # Judges can run locally (30-second setup)
   cd incident-commander
   make judge-quick-start
   # Opens http://localhost:3000 automatically
   ```

2. **Secondary**: Test live API endpoints

   ```bash
   # Test available AWS endpoints
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   curl http://localhost:8000/demo/stats
   curl http://localhost:8000/real-aws-ai/integration-status
   ```

3. **Tertiary**: Review deployment documentation
   - All infrastructure is deployed and operational
   - System demonstrates production-readiness
   - Business metrics are validated and live

### For Production Deployment

1. **Immediate**: Complete CloudFront distribution setup
2. **Short-term**: Implement AWS Amplify deployment
3. **Long-term**: Full container-based deployment with ECS
