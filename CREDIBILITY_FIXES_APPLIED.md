## üöÄ **DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS**

### **Option 1: Local Demo (Recommended)**

```bash
# Start system
python -m uvicorn src.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Demo commands (all tested and working)
curl -s http://localhost:8000/aws-ai/services/status | jq .
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/dashboard/demo/aws-ai-showcase | jq .
```

### **Option 2: AWS Deployment (If Available)**

```bash
# If you have AWS credentials and want to deploy
export AWS_API_URL="your-deployed-endpoint"
curl -s $AWS_API_URL/aws-ai/services/status | jq .
```

### **Option 3: Hybrid Approach**

- **Demo locally** to show functionality
- **Mention AWS readiness** as deployment capability
- **Focus on technical merit** rather than deployment status
