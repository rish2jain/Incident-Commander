## 🎯 Quick Setup (Choose One Method)

### Method 1: AWS Console (Recommended - 2 minutes)

**Step-by-step**:

1. **Open Amplify Console**:
   ```
   https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home?region=us-east-1
   ```

2. **Create New App**:
   - Click "New app" → "Host web app"
   - Select "GitHub" → Authorize AWS Amplify

3. **Select Repository**:
   - Repository: `rish2jain/Incident-Commander`
   - Branch: `merge-latest-dashboard-enhancements`

4. **Configure Build** (auto-detected):
   - Framework: Next.js
   - App name: `incident-commander-dashboard`

5. **Deploy**:
   - Click "Save and deploy"
   - Wait 3-5 minutes
   - Get your URL!

**Your Dashboard URL**:
```
https://merge-latest-dashboard-enhancements.[app-id].amplifyapp.com
```

**From now on**: Just `git push` and Amplify auto-deploys! 🎉

### Method 2: GitHub Personal Access Token (CLI)

1. **Generate Token**:
   ```
   https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
   ```
   - Scopes: `repo`, `admin:repo_hook`

2. **Set Token**:
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN='ghp_your_token_here'
   ```

3. **Run Script**:
   ```bash
   ./deploy_amplify_github.sh
   ```

## 🔄 How It Works

### Initial Setup (Once)
1. Connect Amplify to GitHub (2 minutes via Console)
2. Amplify builds and deploys automatically
3. Get production URL

### Continuous Deployment (Forever)
```bash
# Make changes to dashboard
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push origin merge-latest-dashboard-enhancements

# Amplify automatically:

# → Updates URL
```

**No manual steps!** 🚀
