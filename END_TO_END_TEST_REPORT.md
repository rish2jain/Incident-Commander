## 🐛 **Issues Found and Fixed**

### Issue #1: Backend Service Container Error ✅ FIXED

**Problem**:

```
TypeError: get_realtime_broadcaster() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was given
```

**Root Cause**:

- The service container was passing an `aws_factory` argument to `get_realtime_broadcaster()`
- The function signature doesn't accept any arguments

**Location**: `src/services/container.py:62`

**Fix Applied**:

```python
# Before (causing error)
self._broadcaster = get_realtime_broadcaster(self._aws_factory)

# After (fixed)
self._broadcaster = get_realtime_broadcaster()
```

**Impact**:

- **Critical**: This was preventing the incidents API from working
- **Resolution**: Backend server restarted successfully after fix
- **Validation**: All subsequent API tests passed
