- Highlight sophisticated architecture (Byzantine consensus)
- Emphasize production-ready design (enterprise patterns)
- Show comprehensive local demo (full functionality)

### **Demo Commands (Updated):**

```bash
# Start local system
python src/main.py

# Demo AWS AI integration
curl http://localhost:8000/aws-ai/services/status | jq .
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/dashboard/demo/aws-ai-showcase | jq .
curl http://localhost:8000/aws-ai/hackathon/compliance-check | jq .
```

### **Key Talking Points:**

- **"Complete AWS AI portfolio integration"** - 8/8 services vs competitors' 1-2
- **"Production-ready architecture"** - Enterprise design patterns
- **"Comprehensive local demonstration"** - Full functionality showcase
- **"Deployment-ready system"** - Ready for AWS with proper setup
