# üé¨ 3-Minute Hackathon Demo Script

## Perfect Timing: 3:00 Minutes

### [0:00-0:30] Problem Hook (30 seconds)

**"Every minute of downtime costs enterprises $5,600. Traditional incident response takes 30+ minutes with human teams scrambling to diagnose and fix issues. What if AI could resolve incidents in under 3 minutes, autonomously?"**

_Show problem statistics on screen_

### [0:30-1:15] Solution Overview (45 seconds)

**"Meet the Autonomous Incident Commander - the world's first production-ready multi-agent AI system using ALL 8 AWS AI services for zero-touch incident resolution."**

_Show architecture diagram_

**"Five specialized AI agents work together using Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus:**

- **Detection Agent** monitors with Bedrock AgentCore and Guardrails
- **Diagnosis Agent** analyzes with Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Titan Embeddings
- **Prediction Agent** forecasts with Amazon Q Business intelligence
- **Resolution Agent** fixes with Nova Act advanced reasoning
- **Communication Agent** orchestrates with Strands SDK lifecycle management"\*\*
