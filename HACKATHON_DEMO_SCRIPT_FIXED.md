# üé¨ 3-Minute Hackathon Demo Script (CREDIBLE VERSION)

## Perfect Timing: 3:00 Minutes

### [0:00-0:30] Problem Hook (30 seconds)

**"Every minute of downtime costs enterprises $5,600. Traditional incident response takes 30+ minutes with human teams scrambling to diagnose and fix issues. What if AI could resolve incidents in under 3 minutes, autonomously?"**

_Show problem statistics on screen_

### [0:30-1:15] Solution Overview (45 seconds)

**"Meet the Autonomous Incident Commander - an advanced multi-agent AI system showcasing the complete AWS AI portfolio for comprehensive incident response."**

_Show architecture diagram_

**"Five specialized AI agents work together using Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus:**

- **Detection Agent** monitors with Bedrock and Claude models
- **Diagnosis Agent** analyzes with Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Amazon Q Business
- **Prediction Agent** forecasts with Nova Act advanced reasoning
- **Resolution Agent** coordinates with Strands SDK agent framework
- **Communication Agent** ensures safety with Bedrock Guardrails"\*\*

  -d '{"incident_type": "database_failure", "severity": "high"}' | jq .
```

**"Watch the complete orchestration: Guardrails validate content, Amazon Q analyzes, Claude models reason, Titan generates embeddings, and all agents coordinate through Byzantine consensus."**

### [2:30-3:00] Business Impact (30 seconds)

**"The projected impact demonstrates significant value:**

- **Estimated 90%+ MTTR improvement** - Based on automation benchmarks
- **Projected $2M+ annual savings** - For enterprise deployment
- **Proactive incident prevention** - Early warning capabilities
- **Complete AWS AI integration** - Comprehensive portfolio utilization"\*\*
