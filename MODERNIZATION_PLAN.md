# Incident Commander Modernization Plan

## Technical Architecture Evolution & Production Readiness

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: October 23, 2025  
**Status**: In Execution – Phase 1 Foundations In Progress (updated October 23, 2025)

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🆕 Progress Update (October 23, 2025)

**Phase 1 Foundation Progress**:

- ✅ LangGraph orchestration scaffolded under `src/langgraph_orchestrator/` with parallel diagnosis/prediction nodes and integration tests (`tests/test_langgraph_orchestrator.py`)
- ✅ LangGraph nodes now share concrete agent implementations with the legacy coordinator, with parity tests validating detection/diagnosis/prediction/resolution/communication outputs
- ✅ AgentCore deployment specs, memory/identity configs, and packaging scripts established in `infrastructure/agentcore/` with regression tests and CI manifest generation
- ✅ Distributed architecture registry and EventBridge routing scaffolding introduced in `src/platform/distributed/` and `infrastructure/distributed/` to seed Phase 2 service decomposition

**Current Implementation Status**:

- **Production-Ready Services (2/8)**: Amazon Bedrock AgentCore + Claude 3.5 Sonnet with real API calls
- **Simulation Mode Services (6/8)**: Claude Haiku, Titan Embeddings, Amazon Q, Nova Act, Strands SDK, Bedrock Guardrails
- **Documentation Alignment**: Architecture docs updated to reflect actual vs planned implementation status
- **Demo System**: Professional segmented MP4 recordings with comprehensive screenshots available

This document outlines a comprehensive modernization plan for the Incident Commander system, transitioning from a sophisticated demonstration platform to a production-ready, enterprise-grade AI-powered incident response system. The plan focuses on leveraging modern frameworks (LangGraph), true AWS Bedrock AgentCore integration, and building scalable, distributed architecture.

### Key Objectives

- **Technical Modernization**: Replace custom orchestration with LangGraph
- **True AWS Integration**: Implement proper Bedrock AgentCore Runtime deployment
- **Production Readiness**: Build scalable, distributed architecture
- **Simplified Maintenance**: Reduce complexity while maintaining functionality

---

## 🎯 Current State Analysis

### Strengths

- ✅ Sophisticated multi-agent orchestration concept
- ✅ Comprehensive AWS AI services integration
- ✅ Professional segmented MP4 demo system with H.264/AAC encoding
- ✅ Strong business case and ROI calculations
- ✅ Well-documented codebase with good engineering practices

### Critical Issues & Modernization Opportunities

**Technical Architecture**:

- ❌ Custom orchestration reinvents LangGraph patterns → **Migrate to LangGraph StateGraph**
- ❌ "Byzantine consensus" is actually weighted voting → **Implement true PBFT consensus**
- ❌ Local execution instead of true AgentCore Runtime → **Deploy to Bedrock AgentCore**
- ❌ Single-node architecture limits scalability → **Distributed microservices architecture**

**AWS AI Services Integration**:

- ❌ **Services Gap**: Only 2/8 services production-ready (Bedrock AgentCore + Claude 3.5 Sonnet), 6/8 in simulation mode
- ❌ **Documentation Misalignment**: Architecture docs claim "✅ ACTIVE" for all 8 services, contradicting actual implementation
- ❌ **Prize Eligibility Risk**: Amazon Q, Nova Act, and Strands SDK prizes require real API integration

**System Maturity**:

- ❌ Complex demo system with high maintenance overhead → **Simplified demo controller**
- ❌ Theoretical business metrics need real-world validation → **Real-time metrics collection**
- ❌ Mock data without transparency labeling → **Enhanced transparency with clear mock indicators**

| Nova Act           | $3K Prize         | High                      | Medium                    | **P1**   |
| Strands SDK        | $3K Prize         | High                      | Low                       | **P2**   |
| Bedrock Guardrails | Best Bedrock      | Medium                    | High (safety)             | **P1**   |

### Implementation Roadmap

**Phase 1A (Weeks 5-6): Core Bedrock Services**

```python
# Target: Remove simulation mode from core services
class ClaudeHaikuService:
    def __init__(self):
        # REMOVE: self.simulation_mode = True
        self.bedrock_runtime = boto3.client('bedrock-runtime')
        self.model_id = "anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0"

    async def invoke_model(self, prompt: str):
        # IMPLEMENT: Real API calls instead of mock responses
        response = await self.bedrock_runtime.invoke_model(
            modelId=self.model_id,
            body=json.dumps({"prompt": prompt})
        )
        return json.loads(response['body'].read())
```

**Phase 2A (Month 4): Prize-Eligible Services**

```python

class AmazonQBusinessService:
    def __init__(self):
        # IMPLEMENT: Real Q Business client instead of fallback
        self.q_business = boto3.client('qbusiness')
        self.application_id = os.environ['Q_BUSINESS_APP_ID']

    async def analyze_incident(self, incident_data):
        # IMPLEMENT: Real Q Business API calls
        response = await self.q_business.chat_sync(
            applicationId=self.application_id,
            userMessage=f"Analyze incident: {incident_data}"
        )
        return response
```

## 🧭 Phase Execution Blueprint

To operationalize the roadmap, adopt the following sequencing and ownership guidance:

- **Week 0 (Readiness Sprint)**: Close plan reviews, finalize staffing, and harden development tooling (including CLI configuration baselines) so Phase 1 workstreams can start without friction.
- **Phase 1 – LangGraph Stream**: Senior backend lead drives Weeks 1-4 migration backlog (state schema, node conversion, routing, tests) with an integration test gate before moving to AgentCore dependency work.
- **Phase 1 – Bedrock AgentCore**: Pair the AWS solutions architect with the backend lead to stand up the runtime environment, packaging workflows, and tool integrations in lockstep with LangGraph deliverables.
- **Phase 1 – Demo & Metrics Modernization**: Assign a product-minded engineer plus QA partner to own the simplified demo controller, metrics service, and acceptance validation during Weeks 5-8.
- **Phase 2 – Platform & Consensus**: Form a platform squad (backend + DevOps) to decompose services, deploy to LangGraph Platform, and deliver PBFT consensus with staged fault-injection simulations.
- **Phase 2 – Advanced AWS AI & Production Readiness**: Run parallel workstreams for Bedrock enhancement, observability, security, and compliance so success metrics (99.9% uptime, sub-3 minute MTTR) stay measurable.

Update monthly portfolio reviews to check for widening scope, reuse agent simulation findings, and re-evaluate cost estimates ($1.1k–$3.6k/mo) as infrastructure shapes up.
