# Tasks Document Update Summary

**Date**: October 22, 2025
**Document Updated**: `.kiro/specs/dashboard-backend-integration/tasks.md`
**Purpose**: Align implementation tasks with 3-dashboard architecture and hybrid AWS strategy

---

## Executive Summary

The tasks document has been completely restructured to reflect the **3-dashboard architecture** where:
- **Dashboard 1** remains unchanged (already complete)
- **Dashboard 2** gets enhanced with pre-generated AWS content (NEW Phase 0)
- **Dashboard 3** receives full production integration (Phases 1-8)

**Key Change**: All WebSocket integration work now applies ONLY to Dashboard 3 (Production).

---

## Major Structural Changes

### 1. Added Phase 0: Dashboard 2 Enhancement (NEW)

**Before**: No pre-generation phase, assumed all dashboards would connect to WebSocket

**After**: Complete phase dedicated to Dashboard 2's hybrid AWS approach

```markdown
## Phase 0: Dashboard 2 Enhancement with Real AWS Services (Pre-Demo)

**Goal**: Generate authentic demo content using real AWS services, cache for reliability

Tasks:
- 0.1 Create AWS content generation script
- 0.2 Implement scenario caching system
- 0.3 Generate demo scenarios with real AWS services
- 0.4 Update Dashboard 2 to load cached scenarios
- 0.5 Test Dashboard 2 hybrid approach
```

**Implementation Details**:

```python
# scripts/generate_transparency_scenarios_with_aws.py
- Generate 4-5 incident scenarios using real AWS services
- Call Bedrock/Claude for complex reasoning
- Call Q Business for historical context
- Call Nova for fast classification
- Cache to /dashboard/public/scenarios/*.json with attribution
```

**Value**: Dashboard 2 now demonstrates REAL AWS integration while maintaining demo reliability.

---

### 2. Updated Phase 1: WebSocket Integration (Dashboard 3 ONLY)

**Before**:
```markdown
## Phase 1: Foundation and WebSocket Integration
- Set up WebSocket infrastructure and connection management
- Integrate WebSocket hook into dashboard components (all dashboards)
```

**After**:
```markdown
## Phase 1: Foundation and WebSocket Integration (Dashboard 3 ONLY)

**Goal**: Set up WebSocket infrastructure for Dashboard 3 (Production) ONLY

**Important**: Dashboard 1 & 2 do NOT use WebSocket. All tasks are for Dashboard 3.

Tasks explicitly scoped:
- 1.1: "Only 'ops' dashboard type should receive WebSocket updates"
- 1.2: "Reject connections from demo/transparency dashboards"
- 1.3: "ONLY import this hook in /ops dashboard components"
- 1.4: "DO NOT modify /demo or /transparency dashboards"
```

**Critical Changes**:
- WebSocketManager filtered to only accept 'ops' connections
- Frontend hook usage restricted to `/ops` components
- Clear warnings against modifying Dashboards 1 & 2

---

### 3. Updated Phase 5: Dashboard UI Integration

**Before**:
```markdown
## Phase 5: Dashboard UI Integration
- Update dashboard components to consume real data (all dashboards)
- Enhance transparency dashboard with real AWS data
- Create dashboard mode switching
```

**After**:
```markdown
## Phase 5: Dashboard UI Integration

**Goal**: Update Dashboard 3 (Production) to consume real-time data

**Important**: Dashboard 1 is complete (no changes). Dashboard 2 was enhanced in Phase 0.

Tasks:
- 5.1: Update operations dashboard (/ops) for live data ONLY
- 5.2: Add AWS service visualization to Dashboard 3 (Dashboard 2 has cached data)
- 5.3: Implement routing for 3 separate dashboards
- 5.4: Error handling for Dashboard 3 ONLY
- 5.5: Test all 3 dashboards with their specific data sources
```

**Key Clarifications**:
- Task 5.1: "This is Dashboard 3 - the only dashboard with WebSocket"
- Task 5.2: "Dashboard 2 has AWS attribution from Phase 0 (cached data)"
- Task 5.4: "Dashboard 3 only (Dashboards 1 & 2 don't need this)"
