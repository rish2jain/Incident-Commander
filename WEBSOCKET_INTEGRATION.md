# WebSocket Real-time Integration

## Overview

This implementation adds real-time WebSocket functionality to the Incident Commander dashboard, transforming the demo experience from polling-based updates to live streaming of incident processing.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Incident Processing**: Live updates as agents detect, diagnose, predict, and resolve incidents
- **Agent Activity Streaming**: See each agent's actions and confidence scores in real-time
- **Performance Metrics**: Live MTTR countdown, cost accumulation, and business impact visualization
- **Connection Management**: Automatic reconnection, heartbeat monitoring, and graceful error handling

## Architecture

### WebSocket Manager (`src/services/websocket_manager.py`)

- Manages multiple client connections
- Handles message broadcasting and connection lifecycle
- Provides structured message types for dashboard communication

### Real-time Integration (`src/services/realtime_integration.py`)

- Orchestrates incident processing simulation with realistic timing
- Broadcasts agent actions with detailed context and confidence scores
- Provides engaging demo experience with proper pacing

### FastAPI WebSocket Endpoint (`src/main.py`)

- `/ws` endpoint for WebSocket connections
- Integrated with incident processing pipeline
- Automatic broadcasting when incidents are triggered

## Message Types

1. **incident_started**: Incident detection and initial details
2. **agent_action**: Individual agent activities with confidence scores
3. **incident_resolved**: Final resolution with metrics and actions taken
4. **system_metrics**: Performance and health status updates

## Usage

### Start Demo Environment

```bash
python start_demo.py
```

### Validate WebSocket Integration

```bash
python validate_websocket.py
```

### Manual Testing

```bash
python test_websocket.py
```

## Dashboard Integration

The live dashboard (`dashboard/live_dashboard.html`) automatically connects to the WebSocket endpoint and displays real-time updates with:

- Live agent activity feed with color-coded phases
- Real-time incident timer and cost accumulation
- Agent confidence visualization and status tracking
- Automatic reconnection on connection loss

## Demo Impact

This WebSocket integration transforms the hackathon demo by:

1. **Eliminating Polling Delays**: Instant updates instead of 2-3 second polling intervals
2. **Enhanced Engagement**: Live streaming creates compelling visual experience
3. **Professional Presentation**: Real-time updates demonstrate production-ready capabilities
4. **Reliable Performance**: Consistent 3-minute incident resolution with live progress tracking

The real-time experience showcases the system's autonomous capabilities and provides judges with an engaging, interactive demonstration of the Incident Commander's multi-agent coordination.
