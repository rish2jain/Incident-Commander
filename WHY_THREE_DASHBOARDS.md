# Why 3 Dashboards?

## The Problem with One-Size-Fits-All

Traditional monitoring and incident response tools show the same view to everyone:
- **Executives** get overwhelmed with technical details they don't need
- **Engineers** don't get enough transparency into AI decision-making
- **SREs** need real-time data while demos need reliability

A single dashboard forces compromises that satisfy nobody.

## Our Solution: Purpose-Built Dashboards

Incident Commander implements three specialized dashboards, each optimized for its specific audience and use case.

### Dashboard 1: Executive View (`/demo`)

**Target Audience**: C-suite, investors, non-technical stakeholders

**Primary Goal**: Demonstrate business impact and build trust in AI decisions

**Key Features**:
- **High-level Metrics**: MTTR, cost savings, incidents prevented
- **Byzantine Consensus Visualization**: Shows how 5 agents vote for reliability
- **Business Impact**: Clear ROI with dollar amounts
- **Predictive Prevention**: Showcases proactive capabilities
- **No Technical Jargon**: Accessible to non-engineers
- **Consistent Demo**: Uses cached AWS-generated scenarios for reliability

**Why It Matters**:
Executives need to understand ROI and trust the system. They don't need to see raw logs or agent reasoning - they need confidence that the system works and evidence of business value.

**Example Metrics Displayed**:
```
MTTR: 2.5 minutes (92% faster than traditional)
Cost Saved: $230K per incident
Incidents Prevented: 100+ monthly
Availability: 99.9%
```

### Dashboard 2: Technical Transparency (`/transparency`)

**Target Audience**: Engineers, AI researchers, technical evaluators

**Primary Goal**: Show complete AI reasoning and decision-making process

**Key Features**:
- **AWS-Generated Scenarios**: Authentic incident data from real AWS services
- **Full Agent Reasoning**: Every decision explained with supporting evidence
- **Decision Tree Visualization**: Shows all paths considered
- **Confidence Scores**: Agent certainty with uncertainty quantification
- **Alternative Options**: What was considered but rejected
- **AWS Attribution**: Clear markers showing real AWS service generation
- **No Live Data**: Uses cached scenarios for consistent technical demonstrations

**Why It Matters**:
Engineers and technical evaluators need to understand *how* the AI makes decisions. Black-box AI is unacceptable in production incident response. This dashboard provides complete explainability.

**Example Content**:
```
Detection Agent Reasoning:
├─ Observed: API response time spike (95th %ile: 2.4s → 8.7s)
├─ Evidence: Connection pool metrics show 500/500 in use
├─ Pattern Match: Database cascade failure (87% confidence)
└─ Recommendation: Scale connection pool + investigate DB

Decision Tree:
├─ API Timeout Issue (rejected: no network errors)
├─ Database Connection Pool Exhaustion ✓ SELECTED
│   ├─ Evidence: Pool at 100% capacity
│   ├─ Confidence: 87%
│   └─ Historical Similarity: 12 past incidents
└─ Memory Leak (rejected: heap stable)
```

### Dashboard 3: Operations View (`/ops`)

**Target Audience**: SREs, DevOps engineers, on-call teams

**Primary Goal**: Real-time incident response and system monitoring

**Key Features**:
- **Live WebSocket Connection**: Real-time agent status updates
- **Active Incident Monitoring**: Current incidents with live progress
- **Agent State Tracking**: Which agents are analyzing what
- **System Health Metrics**: CPU, memory, latency, errors
- **AWS Service Performance**: Q Business queries, Nova inference, Memory learning stats
- **Demo Incident Trigger**: Test button for training and validation
- **Agent Reset Controls**: Troubleshooting tools
- **Business Metrics**: Real-time MTTR and cost savings

**Why It Matters**:
Production operations teams need real-time visibility when incidents occur. This dashboard connects via WebSocket for sub-second updates and provides operational controls.

**Example Live Data**:
```
[WebSocket Connected - Latency: 45ms]

Active Incidents: 2
├─ INC-2847: Database Connection Pool
│   ├─ Detection: 8s ago
│   ├─ Status: Diagnosis in progress
│   └─ Agents: Detection ✓ | Diagnosis [analyzing...] | Resolution [idle]
└─ INC-2848: API Rate Limit Exceeded
    ├─ Detection: 3m ago
    ├─ Status: Resolved
    └─ MTTR: 147 seconds

AWS Services Status:
├─ Amazon Q Business: 1,247 queries | 85% confidence
├─ Amazon Nova: 3,891 calls | 142ms avg latency | $2.8K saved
└─ Bedrock Memory: 89 incidents learned | +22.5% confidence
```

## Technical Implementation

### Data Sources

**Dashboard 1 & 2**: Cached AWS-generated scenarios
```
dashboard/public/scenarios/
├── database_cascade.json
├── api_overload.json
├── memory_leak.json
└── security_breach.json
```

Generated using:
- AWS Bedrock (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) for agent reasoning
- Amazon Q Business for historical context
- Amazon Nova for pattern matching
- Bedrock Agents with Memory for learning insights

**Dashboard 3**: Live WebSocket connection
```
WebSocket: wss://api.incident-commander.io/ws
├─ Agent state updates (real-time)
├─ Incident lifecycle events
├─ Business metrics streaming
└─ System health telemetry
```

### Routing

```typescript
// Next.js routing
/demo        → Executive Dashboard (Dashboard 1)
/transparency → Engineering Dashboard (Dashboard 2)
/ops         → Operations Dashboard (Dashboard 3)
```

### Component Reuse

Despite serving different audiences, the dashboards share underlying components:
- **Shared UI Library**: Card, Badge, Button components
- **Shared Hooks**: useClientSideTimestamp, useIncidentWebSocket
- **Shared Services**: WebSocket manager, metrics service
- **Shared Types**: Incident, Agent, Metrics interfaces

This reduces maintenance burden while maintaining audience-specific UX.

## Competitive Advantage

### Traditional Monitoring Tools
❌ Single view for all users
❌ Technical metrics shown to non-technical stakeholders
❌ No AI explainability
❌ Real-time-only (unreliable for demos)

### Incident Commander
✅ **3 specialized dashboards**
✅ **Appropriate detail level per audience**
✅ **Complete AI transparency**
✅ **Hybrid approach** (cached + real-time)

---

## Scalability

Each dashboard scales independently:

**Dashboard 1 & 2**:
- Static hosting (S3 + CloudFront)
- No backend dependency for viewing
- Sub-100ms load times globally
- Zero runtime cost at scale

**Dashboard 3**:
- WebSocket connection pooling
- Auto-scaling ECS tasks (2-10 based on connections)
- Sticky sessions via ALB for reliability
- Handles 1,000+ concurrent connections

---

## Future Enhancements

### Personalization
Allow users to choose which dashboard they see by default based on role:
```javascript
// Example: Role-based default routing
if (user.role === 'executive') redirect('/demo')
if (user.role === 'engineer') redirect('/transparency')
if (user.role === 'sre') redirect('/ops')
```

### Hybrid Dashboards
Power users might want multiple views:
```
/power → Split-screen with Dashboard 2 + Dashboard 3
```

### Mobile Optimization
Dashboard 1 already works well on mobile. Dashboard 3 needs mobile-specific incident response UX.

## Conclusion

**Three specialized dashboards solve three distinct problems:**

1. **Executives** need business confidence → Dashboard 1
2. **Engineers** need technical transparency → Dashboard 2
3. **Operations** need real-time visibility → Dashboard 3

One-size-fits-all fails at all three.

**The result**: Better decisions at every organizational level.
