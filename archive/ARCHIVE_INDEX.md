# Archive Index

This directory contains files that have been archived during the repository consolidation on October 22, 2024.

## Purpose

These files were moved to the archive because they:
- Were progress summaries from development
- Are redundant/superseded versions
- Are old guides replaced by comprehensive documentation
- Are unused dashboard component variants
