- **Detailed breakdown** showing:
  - Tier 1 incident (2000 users affected)
  - $3,800/min business impact rate
  - 27.2 minutes saved
  - Manual cost: $114,000 (red)
  - AI cost: $10,640 (green)

### 2. **‚ö° MTTR Comparison Gauge** (Top Center)
- **Side-by-side bar comparison**: 30 min vs 2.8 min
- **Golden badge**: "üèÜ 10.7x FASTER"
- **Live timeline** showing each agent:

- **Live reasoning feed** showing what each agent is thinking:
  - üîç Detection: "50+ database alerts..."
  - üß† Diagnosis: "Expensive query causing..."
  - üîÆ Prediction: "90% probability of full outage..."
  - üõ†Ô∏è Resolution: "Executing action template..."

## üöÄ How to Use This Dashboard

### Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to dashboard directory
cd /Users/rish2jain/Documents/Incident\ Commander/dashboard

# Open the value dashboard in browser
open value_dashboard.html

# OR start a simple HTTP server
python3 -m http.server 8080

# Then open http://localhost:8080/value_dashboard.html
```

### For Hackathon Demo

**Option 1: Standalone Demo** (No Backend Required)
- The dashboard is fully functional as a standalone HTML file
- All values and data are pre-populated with realistic metrics
- Perfect for quick demos and screenshots

**Option 2: Live Demo with Backend** (Real-time Updates)
- Use the existing [dashboard/server.py](dashboard/server.py) or create a simple endpoint
- Add WebSocket support for real-time value updates
- Connect to actual incident resolution workflows

## üîÑ Making It Interactive (Next Steps)

### Backend Integration

```python
# Example: Real-time business impact updates
from fastapi import FastAPI, WebSocket
import asyncio

app = FastAPI()

@app.websocket("/ws/metrics")
async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket):
    await websocket.accept()

    incident_start = datetime.now()
    tier_cost = 3800  # Tier 1: $3,800/min

    while True:
        elapsed_minutes = (datetime.now() - incident_start).seconds / 60
        manual_cost = 30 * tier_cost
        current_cost = elapsed_minutes * tier_cost
        savings = manual_cost - current_cost

        await websocket.send_json({
            "type": "business_impact",
            "savings": savings,
            "elapsed": elapsed_minutes,
            "percentage": (savings / manual_cost) * 100
        })

        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)  # Update 10 times per second
```

### WebSocket Client (Add to HTML)

```javascript
// Connect to real-time metrics
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8000/ws/metrics');

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);

    if (data.type === 'business_impact') {
        document.getElementById('impact-value').textContent =
            '$' + Math.floor(data.savings).toLocaleString();

        document.getElementById('savings-fill').style.width =
            data.percentage + '%';
    }
};
```
