## 🎮 **HOW TO TRIGGER INCIDENTS**

You have **3 ways** to simulate incidents and watch agents work:

### **Method 1: Click Scenario Buttons (Easiest - Recommended for Demos)**

The live dashboard has **pre-built scenario buttons** that trigger realistic incidents:

**Available Scenarios:**

1. **🗄️ Database Cascade Failure** (Click "Database Cascade" button)
   - **What it simulates**: Database connection pool exhaustion
   - **Agents involved**: All 5 agents
   - **Duration**: ~18 seconds
   - **Business impact**: $103,360 saved
   - **Best for**: Full workflow demonstration

2. **⚡ API Performance Degradation** (Click "API Slowdown" button)
   - **What it simulates**: Sudden 500ms → 3000ms latency spike
   - **Agents involved**: Detection, Diagnosis, Resolution
   - **Duration**: ~12 seconds
   - **Best for**: Quick demo of detection and remediation

3. **💥 Service Outage** (Click "Service Down" button)
   - **What it simulates**: Complete service failure
   - **Agents involved**: Detection, Communication, Resolution
   - **Duration**: ~8 seconds
   - **Best for**: Showing rapid response

**How to Use for Demo:**

```
1. Say: "Let me trigger a real incident - watch the agents work"
2. Click "Database Cascade" button
3. Point to live activity feed: "See the 5 agents coordinating in real-time"
4. Watch metrics update: "$103K saved, 2.8 minute resolution"
```

### **Method 2: Use the API (For Custom Scenarios)**

If you want to create **custom incidents** beyond the buttons:

```bash
# Open a new terminal while demo is running

# Trigger custom incident via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/incidents \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Redis Memory Spike",
    "description": "Redis memory usage at 95%, potential OOM kill",
    "severity": "high",
    "affected_services": ["cache-service", "session-manager"],
    "metrics": {
      "memory_usage": 0.95,
      "eviction_rate": 1200,
      "connected_clients": 5400
    }
  }'
```

**You'll immediately see:**
- Incident appears in dashboard timeline
- All 5 agents start working sequentially
- Activity feed shows live agent reasoning
- Metrics update in real-time

### **Method 3: Automatic Background Simulation (For Continuous Demo)**

The backend can run **continuous background incidents** to show system always working:

**Edit `dashboard_backend.py`** (line ~400):

```python
# Enable background simulation mode
BACKGROUND_SIMULATION = True  # Change from False to True
SIMULATION_INTERVAL = 60      # New incident every 60 seconds
```

**Restart demo:**
```bash
python start_live_demo.py
```

**Result**: System automatically creates realistic incidents every 60 seconds, showing agents continuously working.

## 🏆 **ADVANCED DEMO TECHNIQUES**

### **Show Agent Reasoning Transparency**

**Feature**: Live reasoning feed shows **agent thought processes**

**How to demo:**
1. Trigger Database Cascade incident
2. Scroll to "Agent Reasoning Feed" section
3. Point to live thoughts streaming

**Example reasoning you'll see:**
```
💬 AGENT REASONING (Live Feed):
🔍 Detection: "50+ database alerts, pattern matches cascade failure"
🔬 Diagnosis: "Connection pool exhausted - 20/20 active, queue growing"
🔮 Prediction: "Without action, Payment Service fails in 8 minutes"
⚙️ Resolution: "Scaling pool to 50, timeout to 30s - safe rollback available"
📢 Communication: "High severity - notifying on-call team immediately"
```

**What to say:**
> _"Notice the transparency - we show exactly what each agent is thinking, why decisions are made, and the confidence behind each action. No black box AI."_

### **Demonstrate Byzantine Consensus**

**Feature**: Agents must reach consensus before taking action

**How to demo:**
1. Point to consensus center (⚖️ icon)
2. Show "5/5 Agents Agree" indicator
3. Explain safety mechanism

**What to say:**
> _"Byzantine fault tolerance means we require multi-agent consensus. Even if one agent is compromised or malfunctions, the system remains reliable. This is enterprise-grade safety."_

### **Show Zero-Trust Security**

**Feature**: Security panel shows safety mechanisms

**How to demo:**
1. Scroll to Zero-Trust Security Panel
2. Point to 4 security checks (all green)
3. Highlight compliance badges

**What to say:**
> _"Every action goes through 4 security layers:_
> - _Sandbox validation before execution_
> - _Just-in-time IAM credentials (expire in 15 min)_
> - _Audit logging for compliance_
> - _Automated rollback on any failure_
>
> _We're SOC2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and GDPR compliant by design."_

## 🐛 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Problem: Dashboard shows "Disconnected" (red dot)**

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if backend is running
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# If not responding, restart
python start_live_demo.py
```

### **Problem: Clicking scenario button does nothing**

**Solution:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Check for WebSocket errors
3. Verify backend is running: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
4. Restart demo if needed

### **Problem: Agents complete too fast to see**

**Solution** (optional slow-mo for demo):

Edit `dashboard_backend.py` line ~124:
```python
# Slow down for demo visibility
await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Change to: await asyncio.sleep(5)
```

**Result**: Agents take 2-3x longer, easier to narrate during demo

### **Problem: Want to reset metrics to zero**

**Solution:**
```bash
# Stop demo (Ctrl+C)
# Edit dashboard_backend.py line ~76:
self.performance_metrics = {
    "incidents_resolved": 0,        # Was: 2847
    "total_cost_savings": 0,        # Was: 1240000
    "avg_mttr": 0,                  # Was: 167
    "success_rate": 0.0             # Was: 0.925
}
# Restart: python start_live_demo.py
```
