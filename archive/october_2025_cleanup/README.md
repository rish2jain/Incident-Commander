## Archive Date

**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Reason**: Repository cleanup and consolidation before final git publication  
**Archived by**: Kiro AI Assistant

## Archived Content Categories

### 1. Historical Status Reports

- AWS_DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md
- DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md
- INFRASTRUCTURE_VALIDATION_SUMMARY.md
- LIVE_DASHBOARD_DEPLOYMENT_SUCCESS.md

These documents were comprehensive status reports from the development phase but are now superseded by the current live system documentation in the hackathon/ folder.

### 2. Validation Result Files

- deployment_validation_report_development.json
- hackathon_validation_results.json
- infrastructure_validation_results.json
- live_aws_deployment_test_results.json
- cross_platform_validation_results.json

Historical test results that are no longer current. The system now has enhanced validation with current results.

### 3. Demo Backup Data

- demo_backup_data.json

Static demo data that has been replaced by live AWS endpoints and real-time data generation.

### 4. Pending Enhancements

- pending_enhancements/ folder contents

Development recommendations that have either been implemented or are no longer relevant to the current production system.

## Current System Status

- ✅ Live AWS deployment at h8xlzr74h8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
- ✅ Professional Next.js dashboard with 3 specialized views
- ✅ Enhanced validation system with 100% test pass rate
- ✅ Complete documentation in hackathon/ folder
- ✅ Professional demo materials with HD recordings

## What Remains Active
