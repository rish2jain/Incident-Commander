cdk deploy IncidentCommanderBedrock-${ENVIRONMENT}
```

**Success Criteria:**

- DynamoDB tables created with encryption
- S3 buckets configured with proper policies
- Point-in-time recovery enabled
- Bedrock agents configured

### Phase 3: Compute and API (10-15 minutes)

```bash
# 6. Deploy compute infrastructure
cdk deploy IncidentCommanderCompute-${ENVIRONMENT}

# 7. Build and push Docker image
docker build -t incident-commander:latest .
# Push to ECR (production) or use locally (development)
```

**Success Criteria:**

- ECS cluster created and running
- Lambda functions deployed
- API Gateway endpoints accessible
- Load balancer health checks passing

### Phase 4: Monitoring and Dashboard (5-10 minutes)

```bash
# 8. Deploy monitoring
cdk deploy IncidentCommanderMonitoring-${ENVIRONMENT}

# 9. Build and deploy dashboard
cd dashboard
npm install
npm run build
# Deploy to S3/CloudFront (production) or run locally (development)
```

**Success Criteria:**

- CloudWatch dashboards created
- Alarms configured and healthy
- Dashboard accessible and functional
- WebSocket connections working

---

## Post-Deployment Validation

### Health Checks (5 minutes)

```bash
# API health check
curl https://${API_ENDPOINT}/health

# WebSocket connection test
wscat -c wss://${API_ENDPOINT}/dashboard/ws

# Dashboard accessibility
curl https://${DASHBOARD_URL}
```

### Functional Tests (10 minutes)

```bash
# Run integration tests
python -m pytest tests/integration/ -v

# Test incident simulation
curl -X POST https://${API_ENDPOINT}/demo/incident \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "database_cascade", "severity": "high"}'

# Verify agent coordination
curl https://${API_ENDPOINT}/demo/stats
```

### Business Metrics Validation (5 minutes)

- [ ] Business impact calculator showing realistic metrics
- [ ] Agent consensus achieving >85% threshold
- [ ] WebSocket real-time updates functioning
- [ ] All 8 AWS AI services responding correctly

---

## Rollback Plan

### Rollback Triggers

- Health checks failing for >5 minutes
- Critical errors in application logs
- Business metrics showing degraded performance
- Security alerts or compliance violations

### Rollback Procedures

#### Level 1: Application Rollback (2-5 minutes)

```bash
# Rollback to previous Docker image
aws ecs update-service \
  --cluster incident-commander-${ENVIRONMENT} \
  --service incident-commander-service \
  --task-definition incident-commander:${PREVIOUS_VERSION}

# Rollback dashboard
aws s3 sync s3://backup-bucket/dashboard-${PREVIOUS_VERSION}/ \
  s3://dashboard-bucket/
```

#### Level 2: Infrastructure Rollback (10-15 minutes)

```bash
# Rollback specific stack
cdk deploy IncidentCommanderCompute-${ENVIRONMENT} \
  --parameters PreviousVersion=${PREVIOUS_VERSION}

# Or destroy and redeploy from known good state
cdk destroy IncidentCommanderCompute-${ENVIRONMENT}
git checkout ${PREVIOUS_COMMIT}
cdk deploy IncidentCommanderCompute-${ENVIRONMENT}
```

#### Level 3: Full System Rollback (20-30 minutes)

```bash
# Complete infrastructure rollback
cdk destroy --all
git checkout ${LAST_KNOWN_GOOD_COMMIT}
cdk deploy --all
```

### Rollback Validation

- [ ] All health checks passing
- [ ] No error logs in CloudWatch
- [ ] Business metrics restored to baseline
- [ ] User-facing functionality working
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting operational
