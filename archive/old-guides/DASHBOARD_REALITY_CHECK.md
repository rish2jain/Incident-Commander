      "diagnosis": {"status": "active", "confidence": 0.88},
      "prediction": {"status": "active", "confidence": 0.92},
      "resolution": {"status": "active", "confidence": 0.85},
      "communication": {"status": "active", "confidence": 0.90}
  }
  ```
- **Endpoints**:
  - `/health` - Health check
  - `/incidents/trigger` - Creates mock incident
  - `/agents/status` - Returns hardcoded agent data

---

## 3. Dashboard-by-Dashboard Analysis

### `/ops` - Operations Dashboard (ImprovedOperationsDashboard)
**Reality Score: 15% Real / 85% Mock**

#### ❌ FAKE/HARDCODED Data
```tsx
// All data is HARDCODED in component state
const businessMetrics: BusinessImpactMetrics = {
  mttrReduction: { traditional: 42, autonomous: 6, improvement: 85.7 },
  costSavings: { amount: 2847500, percentage: 95.1 },
  revenueProtected: 2800000,
  uptime: 99.97,
  incidentsPreventedToday: 18,
  trend: "up",
};

const sampleAgents = [
  {
    agent_name: "Detection",
    agent_type: "detection",
    current_confidence: 0.93,
    status: "complete" as const,
    summary: "Anomaly correlation across 143 telemetry signals..."
  },
  // ... all hardcoded
];

const predictiveAlerts: PredictiveAlert[] = [
  {
    id: "pred-001",
    type: "warning",
    message: "API cascade detected | Matches historical incident INC-4512",
    probability: 74,
    timeframe: "Within 15–30 Minutes",
    // ... all hardcoded
  }
];
```

#### ❌ NO Backend Connection
- **No fetch() calls**
- **No axios imports**
- **No WebSocket connection**
- **No API_URL configuration**
- All data lives in component state

#### ✅ REAL UI Components
- Agent cards render correctly
- Animations work
- Modal interactions functional
- Responsive design works

**Verdict**: Beautiful UI displaying 100% fake data

---

### `/transparency` - Transparency Dashboard
**Reality Score: 25% Real / 75% Mock**

#### ❌ FAKE/SIMULATED Data
```tsx
// Simulated agent reasoning function
const simulateAgentReasoning = useCallback(
  (agent: string, step: string, evidence: string[], confidence: number) => {
    const reasoning: AgentReasoning = {
      id: `${agent}-${Date.now()}`,
      timestamp: new Date().toLocaleTimeString(),
      agent,
      message: `${step} - Confidence: ${(confidence * 100).toFixed(1)}%`,
      confidence,
      reasoning: `Analyzing ${step.toLowerCase()} with ${(confidence * 100).toFixed(1)}% confidence`,
      // ... simulated data
    };
    setAgentReasonings((prev) => [reasoning, ...prev]);
  },
  []
);

// Hardcoded initial state
const [agentReasonings, setAgentReasonings] = useState<AgentReasoning[]>([
  {
    id: "sample-detection-1",
    timestamp: "14:23:15",
    agent: "Detection",
    message: "Analyzing baseline deviation - Confidence: 92.0%",
    // ... all fake
  }
]);
```

#### ❌ Incident Trigger is Simulation
```tsx
const triggerIncident = useCallback(async () => {
  // This doesn't call backend - it's a setTimeout simulation
  setIncidentActive(true);

  // Phase 1: Detection (simulated)
  simulateAgentReasoning("Detection", "Analyzing symptoms", [...], 0.92);
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));

  // Phase 2: Diagnosis (simulated)
  setTimeout(() => {
    setCurrentPhase("diagnosis");
    simulateAgentReasoning("Diagnosis", "Identifying root cause", [...], 0.94);
  }, 2000);

  // ... all phases are setTimeout simulations
}, []);
```

#### ✅ REAL Features
- Decision tree visualization logic
- Tab navigation system
- Scenario selection UI
- Performance metrics calculation
- Communication log rendering

**Verdict**: Sophisticated simulation engine with no real backend data

---

### `/demo` - Power Dashboard (if it exists)
**Reality Score: 10% Real / 90% Mock**

According to DASHBOARD_FEATURE_GAP_ANALYSIS.md:
- ❌ NO WebSocket connection
- ❌ NO backend integration
- ✅ Live animation playback
- ✅ Business metric calculations
- ✅ Interactive controls
- All data is hardcoded demo state

**Verdict**: Pure presentation layer with animated mock data

---

## 4. What's Actually Connected to Real Services

### ✅ REAL AWS Integrations (Backend)
Based on agent implementations:

```python
# agents/detection/agent.py
from src.services.shared_memory_monitor import get_shared_memory_monitor
from src.utils.constants import RESOURCE_LIMITS, PERFORMANCE_TARGETS, AGENT_CONFIG
from src.models.incident import Incident, IncidentSeverity, ServiceTier
```

**Evidence of Real Implementation**:
- Alert sampling with rate limiting
- Resource monitoring (CPU, memory)
- Alert correlation algorithms
- Byzantine fault tolerance prep
- Memory pressure handling

### ✅ REAL Data Models (Backend)
```python
# src/models/agent.py
@dataclass
class AgentRecommendation:
    agent_type: str
    action_type: ActionType
    priority: int
    confidence: float
    reasoning: str
    evidence: List[Evidence]
    risk_level: RiskLevel
    estimated_impact: str
    prerequisites: List[str]
    rollback_plan: Optional[str]
```

### ✅ REAL Agent Orchestration (Backend)
```python
# scripts/dashboard/dashboard_backend.py
class AgentOrchestrator:
    async def process_incident(self, incident: Incident) -> None:
        await self._execute_detection_phase(incident)
        await self._execute_diagnosis_phase(incident)
        await self._execute_prediction_phase(incident)
        await self._execute_resolution_phase(incident)
        await self._execute_communication_phase(incident)
```

**This actually works** - but dashboards don't call it!

---

## 5. The Disconnect: Why Dashboards Show Fake Data

### The Problem
```
Real Backend Exists → Dashboards Don't Connect → Show Mock Data Instead
```

### Why This Happened
1. **Rapid prototyping**: Dashboards built before backend was ready
2. **Demo requirements**: Needed consistent, repeatable demos
3. **WebSocket not wired**: Connection layer planned but not implemented
4. **Time constraints**: Hackathon timeline prioritized UI polish

### Evidence of Planned Integration
```tsx
// dashboard/src/components/RefinedDashboard.tsx
// No WebSocket imports found!
// No fetch() calls found!
// No API_URL configuration found!
```

**The integration layer is MISSING**.

---

## 6. What Would Make It Real

### Required Changes (High Priority)

#### 1. Add WebSocket Connection to Dashboards
```tsx
// dashboard/src/hooks/useIncidentWebSocket.ts
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

export function useIncidentWebSocket() {
  const [wsUrl] = useState('ws://localhost:8000/dashboard/ws');
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [connected, setConnected] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    const ws = new WebSocket(wsUrl);

    ws.onopen = () => {
      console.log('Connected to backend');
      setConnected(true);
    };

    ws.onmessage = (event) => {
      const message = JSON.parse(event.data);
      setData(message);
    };

    ws.onclose = () => {
      console.log('Disconnected');
      setConnected(false);
      // Auto-reconnect
      setTimeout(() => ws.connect(), 3000);
    };

    return () => ws.close();
  }, [wsUrl]);

  return { data, connected };
}
```

#### 2. Wire Up Backend Endpoints
```python
# src/main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, WebSocket

@app.websocket("/dashboard/ws")
async def dashboard_websocket(websocket: WebSocket):
    await websocket.accept()

    # Real agent orchestrator
    orchestrator = AgentOrchestrator()

    # Stream real incident data
    async for update in orchestrator.stream_updates():
        await websocket.send_json(update)
```

#### 3. Replace Hardcoded Data with API Calls
```tsx
// Instead of:
const businessMetrics = { mttrReduction: { traditional: 42, ... } };

// Do:
const { data: businessMetrics } = useIncidentWebSocket();
```

## 7. Features That ARE Working (Partial Credit)

### ✅ Real Features (Even if Data is Mock)

1. **Agent Card Interactions**: Click handlers, modal popups work
2. **Tab Navigation**: All 5 transparency tabs functional
3. **Animation Engine**: Phase progression, timers work correctly
4. **Decision Tree Rendering**: Hierarchical visualization works
5. **Confidence Scoring Logic**: Calculations are correct
6. **Byzantine Consensus Visualization**: Algorithm display is accurate
7. **Responsive Design**: All layouts adapt to screen sizes
8. **Dark Theme**: Consistent styling throughout

### ⚠️ Real Implementation, Mock Data

1. **MTTR Calculations**: Formula is correct, inputs are fake
2. **Cost Savings**: Math is accurate, numbers are hardcoded
3. **Agent Status**: UI logic works, status is simulated
4. **Predictive Alerts**: Alert system works, predictions are fake
5. **Communication Logs**: Message rendering works, logs are generated

---

## 8. The "8/8 AWS AI Services" Claim

### Reality Check on Service Integration

From removed widget:
> "Unique Differentiator: Only system with complete 8/8 AWS AI service integration"

#### Let's verify this claim:

**Claimed Services**:
1. Amazon Q Business ($3K prize)
2. Nova Act ($3K prize)
3. Strands SDK ($3K prize)
4. Amazon Bedrock (base)
5. Claude 3.5 Sonnet
6. Nova Micro/Lite/Pro
7. Agents for Amazon Bedrock
8. [Unknown 8th service]

#### Actual Status:

1. **Amazon Q Business**: ⚠️ PLANNED
   - No Q Business API calls in codebase
   - Natural language analysis feature exists but uses Claude directly

2. **Nova Act**: ⚠️ PLANNED
   - No Nova Act specific code found
   - Action planning exists but generic implementation

3. **Strands SDK**: ⚠️ CLAIMED but NOT VISIBLE
   - Agent lifecycle management exists
   - No explicit Strands SDK imports or usage

4. **Amazon Bedrock**: ✅ INTEGRATED
   - Models configured in backend
   - Claude model calls confirmed

5. **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: ✅ INTEGRATED
   - Primary reasoning model
   - Agent decision-making uses Claude

6. **Nova Micro/Lite/Pro**: ⚠️ CONFIGURED but USAGE UNCLEAR
   - Model names referenced
   - Unclear which agents use which models

7. **Agents for Amazon Bedrock**: ⚠️ FRAMEWORK READY
   - Agent structure follows Bedrock patterns
   - Not clear if using Bedrock Agents API directly

8. **Unknown 8th**: ❓ NOT IDENTIFIED

**Realistic Count**: 2-3 services **fully integrated**, 4-5 **partially integrated**

---

## 9. Business Metrics: Real or Fake?

### Claimed Metrics Analysis

#### MTTR Reduction: 85.7%
- **Formula**: `(42 - 6) / 42 * 100 = 85.7%` ✅ Math is correct
- **Source**: Hardcoded `traditional: 42, autonomous: 6`
- **Reality**: ❌ NOT MEASURED - Assumed values

#### Cost Savings: $2.8M (95.1%)
- **Formula**: Savings calculation is accurate ✅
- **Source**: Hardcoded constants
- **Reality**: ❌ NOT MEASURED - Projected values

#### Uptime: 99.97%
- **Source**: Hardcoded constant
- **Reality**: ❌ NOT MEASURED - No uptime monitoring

#### Incidents Prevented Today: 18
- **Source**: Hardcoded constant
- **Reality**: ❌ NOT TRACKED - No prevention tracking system

**Verdict**: All business metrics are **projections/assumptions**, not measured data

## 10. What Judges Will See vs Reality

### What Demo Shows
```
✅ Beautiful, polished UI
✅ Smooth animations
✅ Professional design
✅ Convincing data displays
✅ Interactive elements
✅ Responsive layout
```

### What's Actually Happening Behind the Scenes
```
❌ No backend connection
❌ setTimeout() simulations instead of real agents
❌ Hardcoded confidence scores
❌ Fake incident data
❌ Simulated agent reasoning
❌ Mock business metrics
```

### The Honest Demo Statement
> "This is a **high-fidelity prototype** demonstrating our **planned architecture**. The backend agent system is **implemented and functional**, but dashboard integration is **in progress**. Current demo uses **simulated data** that matches our **real agent outputs**."

---

## 11. Recommendations for Honesty

### For Hackathon Presentation

#### ✅ What You CAN Claim (Truthfully)
1. ✅ "Real multi-agent system with 5 specialized agents"
2. ✅ "Production-ready agent implementations with fault tolerance"
3. ✅ "Sophisticated UI demonstrating our agent coordination"
4. ✅ "Byzantine fault tolerance architecture implemented"
5. ✅ "AWS Bedrock integration with Claude models"

#### ❌ What You SHOULD NOT Claim
1. ❌ "Live production system" (it's not connected)
2. ❌ "Real-time incident response" (it's simulated)
3. ❌ "8/8 AWS AI services integrated" (2-3 at most)
4. ❌ "Measured business metrics" (they're assumptions)
5. ❌ "Autonomous resolution in production" (backend exists, not deployed)

#### 🎯 Recommended Positioning
> "We've built a **production-ready multi-agent incident response system** with real AWS Bedrock integration and Byzantine fault tolerance. Our **interactive prototype** demonstrates how the agents coordinate to resolve incidents autonomously. The backend is **fully implemented**, and we're **actively wiring** the dashboard for live deployment."
