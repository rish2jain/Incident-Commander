# Live Incident Demo Feature - UPDATE

## 🎬 What Changed

The Power Dashboard now includes **live incident progression animation** that shows the complete incident resolution from start to finish, not just the final state.

**Problem Solved**: Dashboard was only showing the completed state, not the live progression
**Solution**: Added animated step-by-step incident resolution with playback controls

---

## ✨ New Features

### 1. **Live Incident Progression** 🔴

Watch the incident resolution unfold in real-time across all 7 steps:

1. **Step 0** - Idle (ready to start)
2. **Step 1** - 🔍 Detection Agent (analyzing anomaly)
3. **Step 2** - 🧠 Diagnosis Agent (identifying root cause)
4. **Step 3** - 🔮 Prediction Agent (forecasting impact)
5. **Step 4** - ⚖️ Consensus Engine (Byzantine consensus)
6. **Step 5** - ✅ Resolution Agent (applying fix)
7. **Step 6** - ✓ Validation Agent (confirming resolution)

### 2. **Playback Controls** ⏯️

Full video-style controls for demo presentation:

- **▶️ Start/Resume** - Begin or continue incident demo
- **⏸️ Pause** - Freeze at current step for explanation
- **⏮️ Restart** - Go back to beginning
- **⏭️ Skip to End** - Jump to completed state
- **1x/2x/4x Speed** - Adjust animation speed

### 3. **Visual State Changes** 🎨

Agents and timeline update dynamically:

- **Idle agents** (○): Gray, 50% opacity, 0% confidence
- **Active agents** (⚡): Blue pulsing ring, animated, confidence building
- **Complete agents** (✓): Green badge, 100% confidence, checkmark

### 4. **Progress Tracking** 📊

Visual progress indicators throughout:

- **Progress bar**: Shows 0-100% completion
- **Step counter**: "3/7 Steps" or "Complete"
- **Status badge**: "🔴 LIVE", "⏸️ Ready", "✅ Complete"
- **Step descriptions**: Real-time narration of what's happening

### 5. **Timeline Animation** ⏰

Events appear one by one as they occur:

- Step 1: Detection event appears
- Step 2: Diagnosis event appears
- Step 3: Prediction event appears
- Step 4: Consensus event appears
- Step 5: Resolution event appears
- Step 6: Validation event appears
- Total time accumulates dynamically

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management

```typescript
const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);
const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState(6); // 6 = complete, 0 = start
const [animationSpeed, setAnimationSpeed] = useState(2000); // ms per step
```

### Animation Loop

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!isPlaying) return;

  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    setCurrentStep((prev) => {
      if (prev >= 6) {
        setIsPlaying(false);
        return 6;
      }
      return prev + 1;
    });
  }, animationSpeed);

  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, [isPlaying, animationSpeed]);
```

### Dynamic Agent States

```typescript
// Agent states change based on current step
const getAgentStateForStep = (agentId: string, step: number): AgentState => {
  // Returns appropriate status: "idle", "active", or "complete"
  // Returns appropriate confidence: 0 to 0.98
};
```

### Dynamic Timeline

```typescript
// Timeline events appear progressively
const getTimelineEventsForStep = (step: number): TimelineEvent[] => {
  return allEvents.slice(0, step);
};
```

## 🎨 Visual Effects

### Agent Card States

```
IDLE (step < agent threshold):
- Background: bg-slate-800/30 opacity-50
- Badge: ○ (circle) opacity-30
- Confidence: 0%
- No animation

ACTIVE (step === agent threshold):
- Background: bg-blue-600/30 ring-2 ring-blue-400
- Badge: ⚡ (lightning) bg-blue-600 animate-pulse
- Confidence: Building (45%-70%)
- Pulsing animation

COMPLETE (step > agent threshold):
- Background: bg-slate-800/50 hover:bg-slate-800
- Badge: ✓ (checkmark) bg-green-600
- Confidence: Final (87%-98%)
- No animation
```

### Transition Durations

```css
transition-all duration-500  /* Agent cards */
transition-all duration-300  /* Badges */
```

### Animations

```
animate-pulse  /* Active agents */
Progress bar smooth animation
```

## 🔄 Default Behavior Change

### Before Update

- Dashboard loaded showing **completed state only**
- All agents ✓ complete
- All timeline events visible
- Static display

### After Update

- Dashboard still loads in **completed state** (step 6) for immediate impact
- **But now includes playback controls**
- Click "Restart Demo" → step 0
- Click "Start" → watch live progression
- **Both modes available**: static complete OR live animation

### Why Default to Complete?

1. **Immediate impact** - Shows all capabilities at once
2. **Quick reference** - Judges can see everything immediately
3. **Opt-in animation** - Choose when to show live demo
4. **Best of both worlds** - Static power + live progression

---

## ⚙️ Customization

### Change Default Starting State

```typescript
// Start at beginning instead of complete
const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState(0); // was 6
```

### Adjust Animation Speed

```typescript
// Default speeds (ms per step)
2000ms = 1x speed (default)
1000ms = 2x speed
500ms  = 4x speed

// Can add more speeds:
const [animationSpeed, setAnimationSpeed] = useState(3000); // Slower
```

### Add Auto-Play on Load

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // Auto-start demo after 3 seconds
  const timer = setTimeout(() => {
    startIncidentDemo();
  }, 3000);

  return () => clearTimeout(timer);
}, []);
```
