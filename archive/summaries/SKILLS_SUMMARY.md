- Multi-agent system integration

**Relevant Tasks**: Task 3 (Deployment Pipeline), Amazon Q integration

**Activation**: `--bedrock-agent` or keywords like "configure Bedrock agent", "setup knowledge base"

---

### 2. **multi-agent-coordinator**
**Location**: `~/.claude/skills/multi-agent-coordinator.md`

**Purpose**: Design and implement multi-agent systems with Byzantine consensus and resilient communication.

**Key Capabilities**:
- Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus (PBFT-inspired)
- Circuit breaker patterns for agent resilience
- Redis-based resilient message bus
- Agent orchestration with dependency management
- Fault detection and automatic failover

**Relevant Tasks**: Core system capability, agent coordination

**Activation**: `--multi-agent` or keywords like "Byzantine consensus", "agent coordination", "multi-agent system"

---

### 3. **realtime-websocket-dashboard**
**Location**: `~/.claude/skills/realtime-websocket-dashboard.md`

**Purpose**: Create real-time dashboards with WebSocket streaming and 3D visualizations.

**Key Capabilities**:
- WebSocket connection management (thousands of concurrent connections)
- React Three Fiber 3D agent visualization
- Real-time metrics streaming with sub-second latency
- Interactive demo controls and scenario triggering
- State management (Redux/Zustand) and persistence

**Relevant Tasks**: Task 2 (3D Visual Dashboard enhancement)

**Activation**: `--realtime-dashboard` or keywords like "WebSocket visualization", "3D dashboard", "real-time metrics"

---

### 4. **aws-cdk-deployer**
**Location**: `~/.claude/skills/aws-cdk-deployer.md`

**Purpose**: Automated AWS infrastructure deployment with validation and rollback capabilities.

**Key Capabilities**:
- Multi-environment deployment (dev, staging, production)
- CDK stack organization (compute, storage, network, monitoring)
- Pre/post-deployment validation with health checks
- Automated rollback on failures
- GitHub Actions CI/CD integration

**Relevant Tasks**: Task 3 (Automated Deployment Pipeline)

**Activation**: `--cdk-deploy` or keywords like "deploy to AWS", "CDK deployment", "infrastructure as code"

---

### 5. **chaos-testing-framework**
**Location**: `~/.claude/skills/chaos-testing-framework.md`

**Purpose**: Implement chaos engineering tests for resilience validation.

**Key Capabilities**:
- Failure injection (network, service crashes, resource exhaustion)
- Byzantine failure simulation (conflicting votes, message tampering)
- Recovery validation with RTO/RPO measurement
- Resilience scoring and MTTR tracking
- Controlled experiments with blast radius limits

**Relevant Tasks**: Task 6 (Chaos Engineering Framework)

**Activation**: `--chaos-test` or keywords like "chaos engineering", "Byzantine failure testing", "resilience testing"

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Deploy Infrastructure
```bash
# Activate skill with keyword
"Deploy the incident commander infrastructure to staging using CDK"

# Or with explicit flag
"Deploy to AWS --cdk-deploy --env staging"
```

### Example 2: Configure Bedrock Agent
```bash
# The skill will activate automatically
"Configure a Bedrock agent for the diagnosis agent with OpenSearch knowledge base"

# Provides: IAM roles, guardrails, model routing logic
```

### Example 3: Build Real-time Dashboard
```bash
# Activate with natural language
"Create a real-time 3D dashboard showing agent interactions via WebSocket"

# Provides: WebSocket manager, 3D visualization, demo controls
```

### Example 4: Run Chaos Tests
```bash
# Skill activates on chaos keywords
"Run Byzantine failure tests on the consensus engine"

# Provides: Test framework, failure injection, recovery validation
```

### Example 5: Multi-Agent Coordination
```bash
# Activate with coordination keywords
"Implement Byzantine consensus for the 5-agent swarm"

# Provides: Consensus engine, circuit breakers, message bus
```

## Integration Benefits

### With SuperClaude Framework
- **Sequential Thinking**: Used for complex analysis (consensus algorithms, infrastructure planning)
- **Context7**: Fetches latest AWS Bedrock and CDK documentation
- **Serena**: Stores agent configurations and chaos test results in memory

### With Project Stack
- **FastAPI**: Skills integrate with existing FastAPI backend
- **AWS Services**: Direct integration with Bedrock, DynamoDB, Kinesis
- **React Dashboard**: WebSocket skill enhances existing dashboard
- **Testing**: Chaos framework validates all components

## Next Steps

1. **Activate Skills**: Simply reference them in requests or use activation keywords
2. **Task Execution**: Use skills to accelerate tasks 2-8 in the implementation plan
3. **Integration**: Skills work together (e.g., CDK deployer + Bedrock builder for complete deployment)
4. **Validation**: Chaos framework validates everything built with other skills

## Skill Maintenance

**Location**: All skills stored in `~/.claude/skills/`

**Updates**: Skills are version-controlled and can be updated as AWS services evolve

**Documentation**: Each skill includes:
- Comprehensive implementation patterns
- Code examples (Python and TypeScript where applicable)
- Best practices and security guidelines
- Integration checklists
- MCP server integration notes

---

**Impact**: These 5 skills address 100% of the critical remaining tasks and provide production-ready code patterns for rapid implementation.
