## ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### Recommendation 2: Correct Resolution Agent Weight ‚úÖ
**Status**: FULLY RESOLVED
**Commit**: `843ce5bf` - fix: Correct Byzantine consensus agent weights and clarify non-voting role

**Changes Made**:

1. **Component Code Fixed**:
   - `ByzantineConsensusVisualization.tsx`: Resolution Agent weight 0.2 ‚Üí 0.1
   - `EnhancedOperationsDashboard.tsx`: Resolution Agent weight 0.2 ‚Üí 0.1
   - Recalculated weighted_consensus values (0.854, 0.888)

2. **Communication Agent Clarified**:
   - Set Communication Agent weight to 0 (non-voting, informational only)
   - Updated status from "agreed" to "informational"
   - Added TypeScript type support for "informational" status

3. **Architecture Documentation Updated**:
   - `HACKATHON_ARCHITECTURE.md`: Expanded Byzantine consensus section
   - Listed all 5 agents with explicit weights
   - Clarified 4 voting agents (Detection: 0.2, Diagnosis: 0.4, Prediction: 0.3, Resolution: 0.1) sum to 1.0
   - Communication Agent marked as non-voting (weight: 0)
   - Added consensus threshold: 85% weighted agreement

4. **Demo Script Updated**:
   - `PHASE4_DEMO_SCRIPT.md`: Restructured agent weight presentation
   - Separated voting vs non-voting agents
   - Added weight rationale explanations

**Verification**:
- ‚úÖ Weights now sum to exactly 1.0
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation successful
- ‚úÖ All documentation consistent
- ‚úÖ Resolution Agent: 10% across all files (was 20% in demo script)

### Recommendation 3: Standardize Consensus Threshold ‚úÖ
**Status**: FULLY COMPLETE

**Completed**:
- ‚úÖ `HACKATHON_ARCHITECTURE.md`: "Consensus threshold: 85% weighted agreement required for autonomous action"
- ‚úÖ `PHASE4_DEMO_SCRIPT.md`: "**Consensus Threshold**: 85% weighted agreement for autonomous action"
- ‚úÖ `ByzantineConsensusVisualization.tsx`: `consensus_threshold: 0.85`
- ‚úÖ `EnhancedOperationsDashboard.tsx`: `consensus_threshold: 0.85`
- ‚úÖ Verified no 70% or 80% references exist in active codebase

**Verification Results**:
```bash
# Searched for: 70%, 80%, 0.70, 0.80
# Result: No problematic threshold values found
# All consensus threshold references: 0.85 (85%)
```

## ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS

### Issue 3: New Inconsistencies (Agent Weights) ‚úÖ ‚Üí RESOLVED
**Previous State**: Resolution Agent 20% in demo script vs 10% in architecture/video
**Current State**: All files now show 10% consistently

### Issue 3: New Inconsistencies (Consensus Threshold) ‚è≥ ‚Üí NEEDS VERIFICATION
**Previous State**: 70% (architecture) vs 80% (script) vs 85% (video UI)
**Current State**: 85% in key files, needs full codebase scan

## üî¥ PENDING - HIGH PRIORITY

### Recommendation 1: Re-edit Video to Follow 6-Phase Structure
**Status**: ‚úÖ SCRIPT READY - Awaiting Recording
**Issue**: Video narrative doesn't match script structure

**Original Video Problems**:
- Skips Phase 1 (main dashboard with $2.8M savings)
- Skips Phase 2 (incident trigger)
- Shows phases out of order (4 ‚Üí 5 ‚Üí 3 instead of 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 5 ‚Üí 6)
- Missing Phase 6 (final results and MTTR)
- Never clicked agent card to show RAG sources

**Script Completed** ‚úÖ (Commit `3bd8e167`):
1. ‚úÖ Created comprehensive [VIDEO_RERECORDING_CHECKLIST.md](../VIDEO_RERECORDING_CHECKLIST.md)
2. ‚úÖ Complete 6-phase narrative with exact timing (total: 3-3.5 min):
   - **Phase 1** (15s): Main dashboard showing $2.8M savings
   - **Phase 2** (10s): "Database cascade" incident trigger
   - **Phase 3** (20s): Multi-agent coordination view
   - **Phase 4** (18s): Byzantine consensus with CORRECTED weights
   - **Phase 5** (25s): Transparency modal + RAG sources (DETAILED - 7s on Evidence tab)
   - **Phase 6** (10s): Return to dashboard with resolution and MTTR
3. ‚è≥ Record new demo video following enhanced script
4. ‚è≥ Verify all features demonstrated using post-recording checklist

**Script Enhancements**:
- **Critical Changes Section**: Upfront summary of all 5 fixes
- **Phase 4**: Step-by-step weight demonstration (Resolution: 10%, Communication: 0%)
- **Phase 5**: DETAILED RAG demonstration (17-item checklist, 7+ seconds on Evidence)
- **Previously Missing Features**: Dedicated verification section for all 5 issues
- **Mouse Movement Notes**: "Slow and deliberate - this is the money shot"
- **Enhanced Narration**: Explicitly mentions all key values (94%, 89%, 86%, 85%, 10%, 0%)

**Ready to Record**: All features verified working, no code changes needed

### Recommendation 4: Implement RAG Visualization
**Status**: ‚úÖ ALREADY IMPLEMENTED - Video Issue Only
**Issue**: Script promises RAG sources display, and **implementation exists**, but video didn't demonstrate it

**Implementation Verified** ‚úÖ:
1. ‚úÖ `AgentTransparencyModal.tsx` has complete RAG sources section (lines 286-340)
2. ‚úÖ "üî¨ Evidence" tab shows Amazon Titan Embeddings sources
3. ‚úÖ Sample data includes RAG sources with correct similarity scores:
   - Detection Agent: 94% (INC-4512), 89% (INC-3891), 86% (RB-Database-007)
   - Diagnosis Agent: 94% (INC-4512), 91% (KB-SQL-042)
4. ‚úÖ UI displays: incident type, title, similarity %, summary, resolution time, success rate
5. ‚úÖ Accessible by clicking agent cards in `/ops` dashboard

**Root Cause**: Video recording didn't click agent cards to show transparency modal with RAG sources

**Required Actions for Video**:
1. ‚è≥ Re-record demo showing: Click Detection Agent card
2. ‚è≥ Show all 4 tabs in transparency modal (Reasoning, Confidence, üî¨ Evidence, Guardrails)
3. ‚è≥ Highlight "üß† Evidence Sources (Amazon Titan Embeddings)" section
4. ‚è≥ Point out similarity scores (94%, 89%, 86%)
5. ‚è≥ Close modal and continue with rest of demo

**Code Evidence**:
```typescript
// AgentTransparencyModal.tsx lines 290-315
<CardTitle className="text-lg flex items-center gap-2">
  <span>üß†</span> Evidence Sources (Amazon Titan Embeddings)
</CardTitle>
<p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
  Analysis based on {agentData.rag_sources?.length || 0} similar cases from historical data
</p>
// ... displays each source with similarity badge
<Badge variant="secondary" className="ml-2">
  {Math.round(source.similarity * 100)}% match
</Badge>
```

### Recommendation 5: Fix Error Message Display
**Status**: NOT STARTED
**Issue**: Video ends with red "1 error" box, undermines "Production Ready" claims

**Required Actions**:
1. ‚è≥ Identify source of error in video
2. ‚è≥ Option A: Remove error from UI entirely (fix underlying issue)
3. ‚è≥ Option B: Add "Fallback Mode Activated" banner with explanation
4. ‚è≥ Update video to show clean final state without error

## üìã ADDITIONAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### Issue 1: Video Narrative vs. Script Narrative
**Status**: Documented, awaiting video re-recording

### Issue 2: Missing RAG Visualization
**Status**: Documented, awaiting implementation verification

---

## üéØ NEXT STEPS (Priority Order)

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Verify consensus threshold (85%) across all files
   - Search for 70%, 80%, 0.70, 0.80 references
   - Update any inconsistencies found

2. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Verify RAG visualization implementation
   - Check `AgentTransparencyModal.tsx` for RAG sources display
   - Test clicking agent cards in `/ops` dashboard
   - Document current state vs required state

3. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Identify and fix error message source
   - Review video to identify error context
   - Investigate dashboard error handling
   - Determine fix vs fallback UI approach

4. **CRITICAL**: Create video re-recording plan
   - Write 6-phase script with exact timings
   - Create recording checklist
   - Verify all demo features work before recording
