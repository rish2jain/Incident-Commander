## 🔧 Technical Details

### Build Fixes Applied

**Fix #1: Repository Structure** (Commit: b952ec42)
- Created root-level amplify.yml
- Added `cd dashboard` command
- Updated artifact paths to `dashboard/.next`

**Fix #2: Command Chaining** (Commit: 7c9af30c)
- Changed `cd dashboard` + `npm ci` to `cd dashboard && npm ci`
- Ensures commands run in same shell context
- Prevents directory change from being lost between commands

### Working amplify.yml Configuration
```yaml
version: 1
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - cd dashboard && npm ci
    build:
      commands:
        - cd dashboard && npm run build
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: dashboard/.next
    files:
      - "**/*"
  cache:
    paths:
      - dashboard/node_modules/**/*
      - dashboard/.next/cache/**/*
```

## 🎬 Next Steps

### When Build Completes Successfully

1. **Verify Dashboard**: Visit https://main.d1o5cfrpl0kgt3.amplifyapp.com
2. **Test Features**:
   - 3D incident visualization
   - WebSocket real-time updates
   - Byzantine fault tolerance indicators
   - AI transparency controls
   - Interactive metrics

3. **Update Documentation**: Mark deployment as ✅ Complete in all guides

### If Build Fails Again

1. Check Amplify Console for new error logs
2. Verify `npm ci` ran successfully in dashboard/ directory
3. Check if dependencies were installed correctly
4. Review Next.js build output for TypeScript errors

## 💡 Key Insights

### Amplify Shell Behavior
Each command in `amplify.yml` runs in a **fresh shell context**. Directory changes via `cd` do NOT persist to the next command unless chained with `&&`.

### Monorepo Best Practices
For projects with dashboard in a subdirectory:
1. Use `&&` to chain directory changes with commands
2. Update all paths to include subdirectory prefix
3. Test builds locally before pushing

### CI/CD Integration
GitHub integration provides:
- ✅ Automatic builds on every push
- ✅ Branch-based deployments
- ✅ Build history and logs
- ✅ No manual file uploads needed
