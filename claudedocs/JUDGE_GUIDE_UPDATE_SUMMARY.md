## ðŸŽ¯ Key Changes

### 1. Updated Quick Start Section

**Before**: Focus on local setup with `make judge-quick-start`
**After**: Three-tier approach prioritizing AWS dashboards:

1. **Primary Option**: Review AWS-Deployed Dashboards (RECOMMENDED)
   - Dashboard 1: https://d2j5829zuijr97.cloudfront.net/demo
   - Dashboard 2: https://d2j5829zuijr97.cloudfront.net/transparency
   - Dashboard 3: https://d2j5829zuijr97.cloudfront.net/ops

2. **Option 2**: Test Backend APIs Directly
   - Health check, integration status, demo stats

3. **Option 3**: Local Setup (If Preferred)
   - Maintained for judges who prefer local testing

### 2. Enhanced Dashboard Descriptions

Added detailed "What you'll see" sections for each dashboard:

**PowerDashboard (/demo)**:
- 4-column interactive layout
- Auto-incrementing savings counter
- Real-time incident timeline
- Functional replay/restart controls
- Visual AWS service showcase
- Transparent mock data labeling

**Technical Transparency (/transparency)**:
- 15-minute AI explainability deep-dive
- Pre-generated content using REAL AWS services
- Service attribution badges
- Agent reasoning visualization
- Confidence calibration metrics

**Production Operations (/ops)**:
- Real operational monitoring
- Live WebSocket connection
- Actual incident management
- Production-ready Lambda deployment

### 3. Reorganized Evaluation Workflow

**New 4-Phase Structure**:

**Phase 1: Dashboard Review (2-5 minutes)** - PRIMARY METHOD
- Review all three AWS dashboards
- Specific evaluation points for each dashboard
- No setup required, instant access

**Phase 2: Backend API Testing (2-3 minutes)** - OPTIONAL
- Test supporting API infrastructure
- Verify health, integration status, metrics

**Phase 3: Technical Deep Dive (5-10 minutes)** - OPTIONAL
- Local setup for comprehensive testing
- Advanced features and testing scenarios

**Phase 4: Business Value Assessment (3-5 minutes)**
- ROI metrics review
- Cost comparison analysis
- Compliance and market positioning

### 4. Updated Key URLs Section

**Before**: Only localhost URLs
**After**: Organized by priority:

1. **Live AWS Dashboards (PRIMARY)** - CloudFront URLs
2. **API Backend Endpoints** - API Gateway URLs
3. **API Documentation** - Interactive docs
4. **Local Development URLs (Optional)** - Localhost for local setup
