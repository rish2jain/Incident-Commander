    "scene1": "Hello, judges. We've built the Autonomous Incident Commander, the first production-ready autonomous incident response system with a unique 3-dashboard architecture. This architecture demonstrates our complete journey: from an executive demo for business value, to an AI transparency dashboard with real AWS-generated insights, and finally, a live production system\u2014all showcasing our path from concept to deployment.",
    "scene2": "This is Dashboard 1, our executive view. It runs on polished, reliable data to clearly communicate our business impact. We are projecting a 75% reduction in Mean Time to Resolution, based on Forrester and IBM Watson benchmarks... and a 70% incident prevention target. For a mid-size operation, this translates to over $2.8 million in annual savings. Here, you can watch our Byzantine fault-tolerant agents coordinate to resolve a critical incident autonomously, showing the full 'zero-touch' resolution lifecycle and proving the core business value.",
    "scene3": "Next is Dashboard 2, our technical transparency view. This dashboard is for AI explainability and is powered by pre-generated, cached data from real AWS services to ensure a reliable demo. This entire reasoning chain was generated using Amazon Bedrock with Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Our 4-week roadmap, which we're documenting for the hackathon, integrates all key prize services. We're integrating Amazon Q Business to retrieve historical incidents, Amazon Nova for sub-second alert classification, and the Strands SDK for agents with persistent memory, allowing the system to learn and improve. Most importantly, we can demonstrate resilience. Watch as we simulate a compromised agent. The system's consensus drops below the threshold, but it gracefully handles the failure, isolates the agent, and still resolves the incident.",
    "scene4": "Finally, Dashboard 3 is our production system. This is our Week 3 deployment target, moving from cached data to a live system. This dashboard connects via a live WebSocket to our deployed backend. As real incidents stream in, all 8 AWS AI services will be actively processing them, providing true operational monitoring of system health, agent status, and live incident response.",
    "scene5": "Our 3-dashboard strategy proves we've moved beyond a simple demo to a production-ready architecture. The backend is 85% complete, and we have a clear, honest 4-week roadmap for full AWS prize service integration. Thank you."
