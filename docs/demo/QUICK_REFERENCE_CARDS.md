Show: Byzantine consensus animation
Say: "Business leaders need trust + ROI"
Point to: MTTR, cost savings, prevention
Time: 30 seconds

```
Show: Agent reasoning, decision tree
Say: "AWS Bedrock generated, Q Business retrieved"
Point to: Confidence scores, evidence, alternatives
Time: 45 seconds

## üõ°Ô∏è CARD 5: TOP 5 QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

### Q1: "How do you ensure AI accuracy?"
```
A: "Byzantine consensus‚Äî5 agents, 3 must agree.
Even with 40% failures, 95% accuracy.
Fully auditable in Dashboard 2."
```

### Q2: "Deployment complexity?"
```
A: "30 minutes. AWS CDK infrastructure as code.
'cdk deploy' and you're live.
Auto-scales: ECS, DynamoDB, CloudFront."
```

### Q3: "Real AWS or mocked?"
```
A: "Real. [Show health endpoint]
All three prize services in production.
Q Business queries historical DB,
Nova routes smartly, Memory learns."
```

### Q4: "Why three dashboards?"
```
A: "One-size-fits-all fails everyone.
Executives need ROI, not stack traces.
Engineers need reasoning, not just metrics.
Operations need real-time, not demos."
```

### Q5: "Production-ready proof?"
```
A: "Health endpoint shows services live.
CDK stack deploys in 30 min.
Operational runbook for day-2 ops.
Live WebSocket with 1,000 concurrent users.
This isn't a prototype."
```

## üéØ CARD 7: TIMING BREAKDOWN

```
Section          | Time | Cumulative | Action
-----------------|------|------------|------------------
Hook             | 20s  | 0:20       | State problem
Dashboard 1      | 30s  | 0:50       | Show consensus
Dashboard 2      | 45s  | 1:35       | Show transparency
Dashboard 3      | 65s  | 2:40       | Trigger live demo
Closing          | 20s  | 3:00       | Summarize + ROI
-----------------|------|------------|------------------
Buffer           | 30s  |            | (if needed)
```

**Critical**: If running over, skip Dashboard 2, go straight to Dashboard 3 (more impressive).
