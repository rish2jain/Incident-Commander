## üí° Pro Tips

### For the Demo

1. **Start Strong**: Opening hook sets the tone. Deliver it confidently.
2. **Narrate**: Don't just show silently. Talk through what's happening.
3. **Point**: Gesture at what you're showing. "See this? That's Amazon Q Business..."
4. **Emphasize**: Pause after key numbers. "92% reduction" [pause 2s]
5. **End Strong**: Look judges in the eye. "Questions?" with confidence.

### For Q&A

1. **Pause**: 2 seconds before answering shows you're thinking
2. **PREP**: Point, Reason, Example, Point (structured answers)
3. **Evidence**: Offer to show proof. "Want to see? [Pull up health endpoint]"
4. **Bridge**: End answers by connecting to your strengths
5. **Confidence**: You know this system better than anyone

### If Things Go Wrong

**Demo Glitches:**
- Don't panic
- Keep talking ("The system is processing...")
- Move to next section smoothly
- Use backup plan (health endpoint or metrics API)

**Forgot What's Next:**
- Look at current screen
- Describe what you see
- Memory will return
- Reference cards in pocket

**Running Out of Time:**
- Skip Dashboard 2
- Go straight to Dashboard 3 (most impressive)
- Do closing
- You'll still hit key points
