# Hackathon Delivery Overview

## Current Readiness Snapshot

- **Core platform:** FastAPI backend and baseline dashboard run locally with LocalStack support.
- **Missing integrations:** Cost guardrails, Bedrock agent builder, adaptive model routing, 3D visualization, PBFT consensus hardening, and chaos validation are still outstanding (see `docs/gap_analysis.md`).
- **AWS posture:** CDK stacks exist, but multi-environment automation, guardrails, and production secret population remain incomplete. A fresh deployment dry-run is required before showcasing.
- **Demo polish:** Legacy dashboard works; modern glassmorphism and 3D agent views are not yet implemented.
- **Validation:** Regression and infrastructure validation scripts exist, but chaos/Byzantine scenarios are not implemented.

## Submission Asset Checklist

| Asset | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Executive summary | ✅ Updated in `README.md` | Reflects current platform capabilities |
| Hackathon readiness brief | ✅ `HACKATHON_READY_SUMMARY.md` | Highlights action items and blockers |
| Submission checklist | ✅ `HACKATHON_SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md` | Tracks remaining tasks prior to DevPost submission |
| Submission package narrative | ✅ `HACKATHON_SUBMISSION_PACKAGE.md` | Includes truthful description and links |
| Demo script | ✅ `DEMO_VIDEO_SCRIPT.md` | Requires refresh once new features land |
| Demo controller | ✅ `master_demo_controller.py` | Runs legacy walkthrough |

## Immediate Priorities

1. **Implement missing product features** documented in `docs/gap_analysis.md` (guardrails, Bedrock agent builder, 3D visualization, cost controls).
2. **Finish deployment automation**: add multi-env CDK pipeline, secrets population, and post-deploy health checks.
3. **Update demo assets** after features are complete (video script, screenshots, live metrics).
4. **Record and upload the 3-minute demo video** referencing the refreshed script.
5. **Submit DevPost package** with live URLs and verified metrics.

## Recommended Validation Flow

```bash
# 1. Local smoke test
python start_demo.py

# 2. Infrastructure checks
python validate_infrastructure.py
python run_comprehensive_tests.py

# 3. Deployment rehearsal (after automation work)
python deploy_to_aws.py --environment staging
python validate_hackathon_deployment.py

# 4. Demo rehearsal
python master_demo_controller.py
python record_demo_video.py  # Helper script if desired
```
