## Remaining Tasks (Phase 5)

1. **Run comprehensive test suite** with full coverage validation
2. **Capture validation artifacts** for submission (coverage reports, performance benchmarks)
3. **Finalize DevPost submission** with updated screenshots and demo video
4. **Performance optimization** and final system validation

## Phase 4 Enhanced Validation Flow

```bash
# 1. Quick judge demo setup (30 seconds)
make judge-quick-start

# 2. Interactive demo mode
make demo-interactive

# 3. Comprehensive testing
make test-demo
python run_comprehensive_tests.py

# 4. Performance validation
make performance-test
python validate_demo_performance.py

# 5. System health check
make health-check
curl http://localhost:8000/dashboard/system-status

# 6. Demo presets validation
curl http://localhost:8000/dashboard/presets
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/dashboard/start-preset-demo?preset_name=quick_demo"
```

## Judge-Friendly Demo Commands

```bash
# Instant demo setup for judges
make judge-quick-start

# Available demo presets
make demo-quick      # 2-minute overview
make demo-technical  # 5-minute deep dive
make demo-business   # 3-minute ROI focus
make demo-interactive # Full judge control

# System management
make demo-stop       # Stop current demo
make demo-reset      # Reset to initial state
make cleanup-demo    # Full cleanup
```

## Enhanced Dashboard (October 2025) ⭐ NEW

The `/ops` dashboard has been significantly enhanced to make technical claims visible to judges:

### Key Features
- **Clickable Agent Cards**: Click any agent to see detailed transparency modal (no need to navigate to /transparency)
- **Byzantine Consensus Visualization**: Real-time weighted voting display showing each agent's contribution
- **Trust Indicators**: Visual badges for Guardrails, PII redaction, Circuit Breaker, Rollback, and RAG integration
- **RAG Sources Display**: Shows Amazon Titan Embeddings evidence with similarity scores (94%, 89%, 86%)
- **Agent Transparency**: 4-tab modal showing Reasoning, Confidence breakdown, Evidence sources, and Guardrails

### Components Added
- `EnhancedOperationsDashboard.tsx` - Main integration component
- `AgentTransparencyModal.tsx` - Detailed agent transparency
- `ByzantineConsensusVisualization.tsx` - Weighted voting display
- `TrustIndicators.tsx` - Security feature badges

### Demo Value
- **Before**: Had to explain Byzantine consensus verbally
- **After**: Judges see weighted voting in real-time (Detection: 0.2, Diagnosis: 0.4, Prediction: 0.3, etc.)
- **Impact**: Proves technical claims are real, not just slides

### Quick Start
```bash
# Start backend and dashboard
cd dashboard && npm run dev
# Open browser to http://localhost:3000/ops
# Click any agent card to see transparency modal
```
