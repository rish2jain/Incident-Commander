# Demo Video Script - Autonomous Incident Commander

**Duration**: 3 minutes
**Target Platform**: YouTube (public)
**Resolution**: 1080p minimum

## üé¨ Video Structure

### **Opening Scene (0:00 - 0:30) - Problem & Solution**

**Visual**: Split screen showing chaos vs calm

- Left: Alert storm dashboard (red alerts flooding screen)
- Right: Autonomous Incident Commander dashboard (clean, organized)

**Narration**:

> "71% of SREs respond to dozens to hundreds of incidents monthly, with average MTTR of 6.2 hours costing $14,056 per minute of downtime. For Fortune 1000 companies, this translates to $200M in annual downtime costs. What if AI agents could prevent 68% of incidents and resolve the rest in under 3 minutes?"

**Text Overlay**:

- "71% of SREs Overwhelmed (State of SRE 2024)"
- "$14,056/Minute Downtime Cost (EMA 2024)"
- "6.2 Hours Average MTTR"
- "$200M Annual Downtime Cost"

### **Architecture Overview (0:30 - 1:15) - AWS Services**

**Visual**: Architecture diagram animation

- Show AWS Bedrock AgentCore at center
- Animate 5 agents connecting to Bedrock
- Highlight AWS services: Lambda, DynamoDB, Kinesis, OpenSearch

**Narration**:

> "Meet the Autonomous Incident Commander - a multi-agent system built on AWS Bedrock AgentCore. Five specialized AI agents work together: Detection correlates alerts, Diagnosis finds root causes, Prediction forecasts impact, Resolution fixes issues, and Communication updates stakeholders. All powered by Claude 3.5 Sonnet on Amazon Bedrock."

### **Live Demo (1:15 - 2:45) - Autonomous Resolution**

**Visual**: Screen recording of actual demo

1. **Trigger Incident** (1:15 - 1:30)

   - Click "Database Cascade Failure" scenario
   - Show alert storm appearing on dashboard

2. **Agent Coordination** (1:30 - 2:15)

   - Real-time agent status updates
   - Show Detection Agent analyzing alerts
   - Diagnosis Agent investigating logs
   - Prediction Agent forecasting impact
   - Resolution Agent executing fixes
   - Communication Agent sending notifications

3. **Resolution Complete** (2:15 - 2:45)
   - Show incident resolved status
   - Display timeline: 2 minutes 47 seconds
   - Show business impact: $15,200 saved

**Narration**:

> "Let's see it in action. I'll trigger a database cascade failure - a complex incident affecting multiple services. Watch as the agents coordinate autonomously..."

> "Detection Agent identifies the root service failure. Diagnosis Agent analyzes logs and traces dependencies. Prediction Agent forecasts a 15-minute outage affecting 2,000 users. Resolution Agent executes database failover and service restarts. Communication Agent notifies stakeholders."

> "Incident resolved in 2 minutes 47 seconds - that's a 95% reduction in MTTR, saving over $15,000 in business impact."

- "2:47 Resolution Time"
- "95% MTTR Reduction"
- "$15,200 Cost Savings"

### **Closing (2:45 - 3:00) - Impact & Innovation**

**Visual**: Results dashboard with metrics

- Show performance comparison chart
- Display key innovations

**Narration**:

> "The Autonomous Incident Commander represents the future of incident response - true multi-agent autonomy with Byzantine consensus, predictive prevention, and zero-touch resolution. Built entirely on AWS with Bedrock AgentCore."
