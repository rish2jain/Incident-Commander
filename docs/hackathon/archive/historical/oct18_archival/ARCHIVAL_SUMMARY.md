## üéØ Why These Files Were Archived

### Planning Documents (Not Implementation)

**WINNING_STRATEGY.md**
- Referenced non-existent `winning_enhancements/` directory
- Contained conceptual features without implementation
- 92% ready ‚Üí champion transformation roadmap
- Useful context, but superseded by actual development

**PRIZE_CATEGORY_STRATEGY.md**
- Embedded unimplemented Python code in markdown
- Amazon Q, Nova Act, Strands integrations (not wired to runtime)
- Prize category targeting strategy
- Planning artifact, not operational guide

### Timeline-Specific Documents

**COMPREHENSIVE_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md**
- Oct 18-24, 2025 specific timeline
- Phase-by-phase integration roadmap
- Dependency checklist for unimplemented features
- Execution timeline now past
- Valuable historical context

### Superseded Documentation

**AWS_HACKATHON_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md**
- Overlapped with DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST_AND_ROLLBACK_PLAN.md
- Comprehensive but redundant
- Unique sections could be merged if needed
- Reference guide, not primary deployment doc
