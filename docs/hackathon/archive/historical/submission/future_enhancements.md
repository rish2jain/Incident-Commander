# Autonomous Incident Commander – Future Enhancements Roadmap

## 1. Explainability & Trust
- **Incident Transparency Timeline**: Capture every model call, prompt, guardrail decision, and remediation step in a searchable ledger for auditors and SRE reviews.
- **Decision Rationale Summaries**: Auto-generate human-readable explanations for why each action or recommendation was taken, including confidence and fallback paths.
- **Counterfactual Explorer**: Let operators replay incidents with alternative choices to understand potential outcomes and tune policies.

**Status (Oct 18, 2025):** ✅ Delivered via the new timeline ledger in `AgentSwarmCoordinator`, explainability service (`/incidents/{id}/explainability`), and counterfactual explorer support throughout the API.

## 2. Advanced FinOps Visibility
- **Real-Time Cost Dashboards**: Track Bedrock, Amazon Q, Nova Act, and infrastructure spend per team, incident, and capability.
- **Budget Guardrails**: Enforce tenant-specific daily/weekly cost caps; orchestrator pauses or defers high-cost actions when thresholds near limits.
- **Optimization Suggestions**: Recommend model downgrades or sampling adjustments when usage patterns exceed historical baselines.

**Status (Oct 18, 2025):** ✅ Implemented through the FinOps service (`/finops/dashboard`, `/finops/guardrails`) with active budget guardrails and cost optimization surfacing real-time recommendations.

## 3. Operator Controls & UX
- **Autonomy Toggle Panel**: Self-serve UI for confidence thresholds, approval flows, and incident classifications (read-only → advisory → execute).
- **Safe Dry-Run Mode**: Simulate full responses without touching production systems so teams can validate new policies.
- **Scenario Builder**: Allow users to craft “what if” incidents to test resilience and response quality on demand.

**Status (Oct 18, 2025):** ✅ Operator control service exposes autonomy toggles, incident dry-run controls, and scenario builder endpoints under `/operator/*` for UX and governance.

## 4. Integration Marketplace
- **Connector Catalog**: Publish certified integrations (PagerDuty, ServiceNow, Jira, GitLab, Slack) with automated smoke tests and rollback recipes.
- **Sandbox Verification**: Provide a staging playground for new integrations with simulated telemetry and incidents.
- **Versioned Templates**: Maintain IaC snippets and prompt packages for quick onboarding of new environments.

## 5. Insights & Analytics
- **Resilience Scorecards**: Summaries of mean prevention time, near-miss count, change failure rate, and improvement trends.
- **SLO Impact Analysis**: Map incidents to service SLOs and quantify avoided downtime or customer pain.
- **Cross-Team Benchmarking**: Compare performance across applications or business units while preserving privacy.

**Status (Oct 18, 2025):** ✅ Analytics insights endpoint (`/analytics/insights`) now generates live scorecards, SLO impact views, and cross-team benchmarks.

## 6. Automated Governance
- **Compliance Packs**: Auto-generate SOC 2 / ISO 27001 evidence bundles tied to each incident’s audit trail.
- **Policy Drift Alerts**: Flag when approval rules, guardrails, or secrets diverge from baseline configurations.
- **Scheduled Reviews**: Calendar reminders with compiled metrics for quarterly risk and cost steering committees.

## 7. Continuous Learning & Simulation
- **Synthetic Incident Generator**: Use Amazon Q and Nova Act to fabricate realistic outage scenarios for training without harming production.
- **Chaos & Load Harness**: Integrate with the existing chaos framework to ensure new capabilities survive fault injections.
- **Feedback Loop Capture**: Store operator overrides and approvals to retrain prompts and adjust consensus weights.

## 8. Predictive Capacity & Ops
- **Capacity Forecasting**: Blend historical incidents with workload trends to suggest proactive scaling actions.
- **Change Risk Advisor**: Evaluate upcoming releases or infrastructure changes against incident history to predict risk scores.
- **Auto-Pipeline Hooks**: Offer pre-built actions for Terraform, Kubernetes, or AWS Step Functions so predictions lead to immediate protective changes.
