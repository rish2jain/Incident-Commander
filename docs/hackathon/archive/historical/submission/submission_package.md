### üöÄ Project Overview

**Autonomous Incident Commander** is an AI-powered multi-agent system that provides zero-touch incident resolution for cloud infrastructure. The system uses coordinated agent swarms to detect, diagnose, and resolve incidents autonomously, reducing mean time to resolution (MTTR) from 30+ minutes to under 3 minutes.

### üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

#### Core AWS Services

- **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore** - Multi-agent orchestration and coordination
- **Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3.5)** - Foundation model for all agent reasoning
- **AWS Lambda** - Serverless agent execution
- **Amazon DynamoDB** - Event sourcing and state management
- **Amazon Kinesis** - Real-time event streaming
- **OpenSearch Serverless** - Vector database for RAG memory system
- **Amazon S3** - Incident data and artifact storage
- **API Gateway** - REST API endpoints for demo interface
- **CloudWatch** - Comprehensive monitoring and logging

#### Multi-Agent System

1. **Detection Agent** - Correlates alerts and detects incidents using LLM reasoning
2. **Diagnosis Agent** - Performs root cause analysis with log investigation
3. **Prediction Agent** - Forecasts incident impact and prevents future issues
4. **Resolution Agent** - Executes automated remediation actions
5. **Communication Agent** - Manages stakeholder notifications and escalations

### üéØ Key Features

#### Autonomous Capabilities

- **Zero-Touch Resolution**: Complete incident handling without human intervention
- **Byzantine Consensus**: Multi-agent decision making with fault tolerance
- **Self-Learning System**: RAG memory learns from historical incident patterns
- **Predictive Prevention**: Forecasts and prevents incidents 15-30 minutes early
- **Adaptive Scaling**: Auto-scales based on incident complexity and patterns

#### Business Impact

- **95% MTTR Reduction**: From 30+ minutes to under 3 minutes
- **$15,000+ Cost Savings** per major incident resolution
- **Zero Alert Fatigue**: Intelligent correlation of 10,000+ daily alerts
- **24/7 Operation**: Continuous autonomous monitoring and response

### üõ°Ô∏è Enterprise Security

- **Zero Trust Architecture** - Never trust, always verify approach
- **IAM Role-Based Access** - Least privilege security model
- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance** - Resilient to agent failures and conflicts
- **Audit Trail** - Complete cryptographic integrity verification
- **Circuit Breakers** - Fault isolation and graceful degradation

### üé≠ Demo Scenarios

The system includes 5 comprehensive demo scenarios:

1. **Database Cascade Failure** - Multi-service dependency resolution
2. **DDoS Attack Response** - Traffic filtering and scaling response
3. **Memory Leak Detection** - Resource optimization and container restart
4. **API Rate Limit Breach** - Load balancing and capacity management
5. **Storage System Failure** - Data recovery and failover orchestration

### üìä Performance Metrics

| Agent         | Target Response | Max Response | Actual Performance |
| ------------- | --------------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
