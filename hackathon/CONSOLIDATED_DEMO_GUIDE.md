## Overview

Complete guide for demonstrating the Autonomous Incident Commander system for hackathon judges and technical evaluators. This consolidates all demo-related information into a single, authoritative document.

## üöÄ Quick Demo Options

### Option 1: Watch Recorded Demo (2-3 minutes)

**Best for**: Initial evaluation, time-constrained judges

```bash
# Latest professional recording
open demo_recordings/videos/dc34a876ad0dda52ecffcaeb3faf502e.webm

# View comprehensive screenshots
ls demo_recordings/screenshots/
```

### Option 2: Live Interactive Demo (5-10 minutes)

**Best for**: Technical deep-dive, hands-on evaluation

```bash
# Start backend
python src/main.py
