# Hackathon Readiness Summary

_Last updated: October 19, 2025_

This summary reflects the consolidated hackathon guidance described in `docs/hackathon/README.md`.

## Deployment & Demo Snapshot

- **Local experience:** Legacy FastAPI demo still launches via `python start_demo.py`.
- **AWS deployment:** CDK stacks are present but require automation, guardrails, and secrets work before a fresh deployment can be attempted.
- **Dashboard polish:** Modern React/3D dashboard remains outstanding; current demo uses legacy UI.
- **Validation:** Comprehensive integration scripts exist, yet chaos, Byzantine, and MTTR verification are not implemented.

## Critical Gaps Before Submission

| Area | Gap | Required Action |
|------|-----|-----------------|
| Bedrock agents | No guardrail-protected agent configuration | Implement builder + guardrails (see `docs/gap_analysis.md`) |
| Cost controls | Workload-aware caps/model routing not wired | Add orchestration logic and tests |
| Visualization | 3D scene + WebSocket batching absent | Build React Three Fiber layer and optimize broadcast manager |
| Consensus | PBFT workflow unfinished | Complete vote verification, quorum checks, malicious isolation |
| Resilience | Chaos/Byzantine tests missing | Create chaos framework and MTTR validation suite |

## Submission Gate Checklist

| Item | Status | Owner |
|------|--------|-------|
| Implement gap items above | 🔴 Pending | Engineering |
| Re-run `run_comprehensive_tests.py` | 🟡 Pending | QA |
| Stage AWS deployment rehearsal | 🔴 Pending | DevOps |
| Refresh demo assets/video | 🔴 Pending | GTM |
| Complete DevPost submission | 🔴 Pending | PM |

## Next Steps

1. Close feature gaps described in `docs/gap_analysis.md`.
2. Finish AWS deployment automation and rehearsal.
3. Update demo assets once new functionality ships.
