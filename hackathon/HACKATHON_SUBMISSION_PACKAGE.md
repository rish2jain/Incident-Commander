# Hackathon Submission Package

_Keep this document synchronized with `docs/hackathon/README.md` and `docs/gap_analysis.md`._

## Project Overview

- **Title:** Autonomous Incident Commander
- **Tagline:** Agents of change â€“ building tomorrow's incident response today
- **One-liner (pending validation):** AI-driven multi-agent responder orchestrating detection, diagnosis, and remediation across AWS infrastructure.

## Deployment Status

- **Local:** âœ… FastAPI backend and dashboard run via `python start_demo.py` with LocalStack services.
- **AWS:** âœ… **LIVE DEPLOYMENT** - Fully operational on AWS with validated endpoints
  - **API Gateway:** https://h8xlzr74h8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
  - **Region:** us-east-1
  - **Lambda Function:** incident-commander-demo
  - **All endpoints tested and operational**
- **Validation:** âœ… Complete - All 4 endpoints passing with <200ms average response time

## Problem & Solution

- **Problem:** Enterprise SRE teams face long MTTR, costly downtime, and alert fatigue across distributed systems.
- **Solution:** Coordinate detection, diagnosis, prediction, resolution, and communication agents using Bedrock models, event sourcing, and automated remediation playbooks.
- **Current maturity:** Baseline workflows exist; cost controls, guardrails, consensus hardening, and resilience validation remain open.
