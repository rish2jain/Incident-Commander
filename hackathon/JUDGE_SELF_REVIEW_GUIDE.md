## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Backend not responding
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check if backend is running
curl http://localhost:8000/dashboard/health

# If not, start it
python -m uvicorn src.main:app --reload
```

### Issue: Dashboard shows connection error
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check dashboard is running
curl http://localhost:3000

# If not, start it
cd dashboard && npm run dev
```

### Issue: WebSocket not connecting
**Solution**:
1. Verify backend is running
2. Check Dashboard 3 specifically (only one with WebSocket)
3. Look for WebSocket endpoint: `ws://localhost:8000/dashboard/ws`
4. Check browser console for connection errors

### Issue: No agents showing in health check
**Solution**: This is okay - agents are initialized on-demand when incidents are processed. The system should still show `active_agents: 0` with `status: healthy`.
