## 🎯 Demo Script for Presentations

### Opening (30 seconds)

> "This is our PowerDashboard - a 4-column interactive demonstration of the world's first autonomous incident commander. Notice the live savings counter showing 47 incidents resolved today with zero human interventions."

### Column 1 Walkthrough (45 seconds)

> "Column 1 shows our live system status. We've saved $156K today alone, with our 5 AI agents maintaining 90%+ confidence scores. These industry firsts include Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus and predictive incident prevention."

### Column 2 Impact Analysis (60 seconds)

> "Column 2 demonstrates our impact. Manual response takes 30+ minutes, our AI system resolves in 2.5 minutes - that's 91.8% faster. The timeline shows our 6-step process: detection, diagnosis, prediction, consensus, resolution, and validation - all completed in 32 seconds."

### Column 3 AI Intelligence (45 seconds)

> "Column 3 reveals our AI coordination. Watch the Byzantine consensus flow - even if agents are compromised, we maintain 94% confidence. The transparency panel shows actual agent reasoning, not black box decisions."

### Column 4 Business Value (60 seconds)

> "Column 4 calculates real business impact. This critical Payment API incident would cost $302K with manual response, but our AI resolved it for $25K - saving $277K. We also predict future incidents with 87% confidence, preventing problems before they occur."

### Interactive Controls (30 seconds)

> "The demo controls are fully functional with React state management. Watch as the live metrics auto-increment every 5 seconds, and use the speed controls to cycle through 1x, 2x, and 4x animation speeds. The progress tracking shows real-time completion percentages, and the restart functionality resets the entire demonstration state. This isn't just a static display - it's an interactive system with production-ready state management."

## 🔧 Technical Implementation
