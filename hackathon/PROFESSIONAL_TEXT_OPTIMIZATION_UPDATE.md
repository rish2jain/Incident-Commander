- **Methodology Explanation**: "Prediction Agent synthesizes telemetry drift, historical regressions, and correlation weights to forecast emerging risks."

### 6. Detailed Agent Intelligence

Each agent now displays specific analysis results:

- **Detection**: "Anomaly correlation across 143 telemetry signals. Baseline drift 0.6% ‚Äî within guardrails."
- **Diagnosis**: "Query plan regression isolated; lock-wait accumulation detected and mitigated."
- **Prediction**: "API cascade pattern under evaluation. Awaiting customer-impact confirmation."
- **Resolution**: "Canary rollback validated; full restoration pending verification."
- **Communication**: "Stakeholder updates synchronized across Slack & email; awaiting executive acknowledgment."

### 7. Enhanced Security & Trust

- **Visual Indicators**: üõ°Ô∏è Verified Safe, üîí PII Protected, ‚úÖ System Healthy, üîÑ Rollback Ready, üß† 3 Validated Sources
- **Compliance Messaging**: "All core systems and guardrails verified within compliance parameters."

### 8. Comprehensive Byzantine Consensus

- **Weighted Contributions**: Detailed breakdown showing each agent's contribution
- **Clear Status**: "Status: Autonomous Execution Approved"
- **Threshold Explanation**: "Weighted multi-agent consensus exceeds 85% threshold ‚Äî validating unified confidence for autonomous execution."

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
