### Dashboard 1: Executive Demo (/demo)

- **Purpose**: 3-5 minute business value presentation for judges/executives
- **Data**: Polished mock data (intentional, for reliability)
- **AWS**: Visual showcase of capabilities and architecture
- **Status**: ‚úÖ READY (no changes needed)

### Dashboard 2: Technical Transparency (/transparency)

- **Purpose**: 15-minute AI explainability deep-dive for technical judges
- **Data**: Pre-generated using REAL AWS services, cached for consistency
- **AWS**: Content generated by AWS services, with service attribution badges
- **Status**: üÜï ENHANCED (AWS service attribution added)

### Dashboard 3: Production Live (/live)

- **Purpose**: Real operational monitoring on AWS infrastructure
- **Data**: Live WebSocket connection to deployed backend
- **AWS**: ALL 8 services actively processing real incidents
- **Status**: üöÄ IN DEVELOPMENT (4-week roadmap, Week 3 deployment)

### Dashboard 2 Demo (5 minutes)

> "Now for technical transparency: This reasoning was generated using real AWS Bedrock services. Our roadmap includes Amazon Q Business for retrieving similar historical incidents, Nova Micro for sub-50ms alert classification, and agents with memory that learn and improve. Every reasoning step shows which AWS service generated it."

### Dashboard 3 Preview (2 minutes)

> "Finally, our production system roadmap: Week 3 deployment with live WebSocket connection streaming real incident data. All 8 AWS AI services will be actively processing. This shows system health metrics, incident history, and true operational monitoring."

### Closing (1 minute)
