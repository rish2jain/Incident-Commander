[Pause for impact]

_"Meet the Autonomous Incident Commander - the world's first production-ready multi-agent AI system with REAL AWS AI service integrations. Not simulations - actual API calls to Amazon Q Business, Nova Models, and more."_

#### **Screen Actions:**

- Show caption: "‚úÖ Real AWS AI Integration"
- Display live system status

---

### **REAL AWS AI SHOWCASE** (0:30 - 1:30)

#### **Visual:**

- Navigate to live AWS deployment
- Show real API calls to AWS services

#### **Voiceover:**

_"This system integrates REAL AWS AI services with actual API calls:"_

_"Amazon Q Business provides intelligent incident analysis with real business insights. Amazon Nova Models deliver advanced multimodal reasoning via Bedrock Runtime. Amazon Comprehend analyzes sentiment and entities. Amazon Textract processes documents. Amazon Translate supports global teams. Amazon Polly creates voice alerts."_

_"All working together in production - not demos, not simulations - real AWS AI services."_

#### **Screen Actions:**

```bash
# Show real AWS AI services status
curl https://h8xlzr74h8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/real-aws-ai/services/status

# Test Amazon Q Business integration
curl -X POST https://h8xlzr74h8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/real-aws-ai/amazon-q/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "database_cascade", "description": "Connection pool exhaustion"}'

# Test Nova Models integration
curl -X POST https://h8xlzr74h8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/real-aws-ai/nova-models/reason \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

### **LIVE INCIDENT DEMONSTRATION** (1:30 - 2:30)

#### **Visual:**

- Show your enhanced video with captions: "üö® Database Cascade Incident"
- Display real-time agent coordination

#### **Voiceover:**

_"Watch a live incident response. I'm triggering a database cascade failure - connection pool exhaustion affecting thousands of users."_

_"The system immediately springs into action: Amazon Q analyzes business impact, Nova Models plan advanced remediation, Byzantine consensus ensures fault tolerance even with compromised agents."_

_"Notice the real-time coordination with enhanced dashboard performance - this isn't scripted, it's autonomous AI agents making decisions and taking action with improved TypeScript type safety and scroll management."_

#### **Screen Actions:**

```bash
# Show comprehensive AI analysis
curl https://h8xlzr74h8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/real-aws-ai/demo/full-showcase
