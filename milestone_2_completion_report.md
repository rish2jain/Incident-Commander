- ✅ Resolution Agent (complete with zero-trust security and sandbox validation)
- ✅ Communication Agent (complete with multi-channel notifications and stakeholder routing)
```

**Issue**: Status marked as "PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED" despite completion indicators.

**Reality**: Code review shows ALL THREE AGENTS are FULLY IMPLEMENTED with:
- Complete functionality per requirements
- Production-ready error handling
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Integration with all system components
- Security hardening and defensive programming

**Recommendation**: Update tasks.md to reflect **"✅ MILESTONE 2 COMPLETE (100%)"**
