# Pending Enhancements

This directory contains comprehensive recommendations and improvement proposals for the Incident Commander codebase.

## Purpose

The `pending_enhancements/` directory serves as a central location for:
- **Architecture improvement proposals**
- **Code reorganization recommendations**
- **Technical debt reduction strategies**
- **Feature enhancement specifications**
- **Performance optimization plans**

## Status: üìã Review & Planning Phase

These enhancements are **pending implementation** and require:
1. Team review and consensus
2. Priority assignment
3. Resource allocation
4. Implementation scheduling

## Current Documents

### 1. Codebase Structure Recommendations
**File:** [CODEBASE_STRUCTURE_RECOMMENDATIONS.md](CODEBASE_STRUCTURE_RECOMMENDATIONS.md)
**Status:** Ready for Review
**Created:** October 22, 2025
**Estimated Effort:** 14-21 hours (3 phases)

**Summary:**
Comprehensive reorganization plan addressing:
- Services directory organization (90+ files ‚Üí domain-based structure)
- Dashboard component consolidation (4 variants ‚Üí 1 canonical)
- Route consolidation (8 routes ‚Üí 3-4 clear routes)
- Documentation organization (156 files ‚Üí unified structure)

**Priority Breakdown:**
- üî¥ **P0 Critical:** 3 items (9-13 hours) - Services, components, routes
- üü† **P1 High:** 2 items (3-5 hours) - Scripts, documentation
- üü° **P2 Medium:** 2 items (1.5-3 hours) - Archives, recordings
- üîµ **P3 Low:** 1 item (5 minutes) - Verification

**Expected Impact:**
- 80% improvement in code discoverability
- 60% reduction in component naming confusion
- 50% faster onboarding for new developers
- Professional codebase presentation

## Implementation Guidelines

### Safety First
1. **Always create backups** before making changes
2. **Use feature branches** for all enhancements
3. **Write comprehensive tests** for new functionality
4. **Document all changes** thoroughly
5. **Get code review** before merging

### Best Practices
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
- Update documentation alongside code changes
- Commit incrementally with clear messages
- Verify tests pass after each change

### Communication
- Notify team before starting major enhancements
- Share progress updates regularly
- Document decisions and trade-offs
- Request feedback early and often
- Celebrate completed enhancements
