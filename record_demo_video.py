🎬 DEMO VIDEO RECORDING SCRIPT (3 minutes)
============================================================

📋 PRE-RECORDING CHECKLIST:
□ Demo environment running at http://localhost:8000
□ Screen recording software ready (OBS, QuickTime, etc.)
□ Audio recording enabled
□ Browser window sized appropriately
□ Script rehearsed

🎯 RECORDING SEQUENCE:

⏱️  0:00-0:30 - OPENING (Problem & Solution)
----------------------------------------
VISUAL: Split screen or transition showing:
- Left: Chaotic alert dashboard (lots of red alerts)
- Right: Clean Autonomous Incident Commander interface

NARRATION:
"Enterprise teams face over 10,000 alerts daily, with major incidents 
costing $800,000+ and taking 30+ minutes to resolve. What if AI agents 
could handle this autonomously in under 3 minutes?"

TEXT OVERLAYS:
- "10,000+ Daily Alerts"
- "$800K+ Per Major Incident"
- "30+ Minutes MTTR"

⏱️  0:30-1:15 - ARCHITECTURE (AWS Services)
----------------------------------------
VISUAL: Show architecture diagram or navigate to docs
- Highlight AWS Bedrock AgentCore
- Show 5 agents connecting
- Point out AWS services

NARRATION:
"Meet the Autonomous Incident Commander - a multi-agent system built on 
AWS Bedrock AgentCore. Five specialized AI agents work together: Detection 
correlates alerts, Diagnosis finds root causes, Prediction forecasts impact, 
Resolution fixes issues, and Communication updates stakeholders. All powered 
by Claude 3.5 Sonnet on Amazon Bedrock."

TEXT OVERLAYS:
- "5 Specialized AI Agents"
- "AWS Bedrock AgentCore"
- "Claude 3.5 Sonnet LLM"

⏱️  1:15-2:45 - LIVE DEMO (Autonomous Resolution)
----------------------------------------
VISUAL: Screen recording of actual demo

1:15-1:30 - Trigger Incident:
- Navigate to http://localhost:8000
- Click "Database Cascade Failure" scenario
- Show alert storm appearing

NARRATION:
"Let's see it in action. I'll trigger a database cascade failure - 
a complex incident affecting multiple services."

1:30-2:15 - Agent Coordination:
- Show real-time agent status updates
- Point out each agent's actions
- Highlight the coordination

NARRATION:
"Watch as the agents coordinate autonomously. Detection Agent identifies 
the root service failure. Diagnosis Agent analyzes logs and traces 
dependencies. Prediction Agent forecasts impact. Resolution Agent executes 
fixes. Communication Agent notifies stakeholders."

2:15-2:45 - Resolution Complete:
- Show incident resolved status
- Display timeline and metrics
- Highlight business impact

NARRATION:
"Incident resolved in 2 minutes 47 seconds - that's a 95% reduction 
in MTTR, saving over $15,000 in business impact."

TEXT OVERLAYS:
- "Real-time Agent Coordination"
- "2:47 Resolution Time"
- "95% MTTR Reduction"
- "$15,200 Cost Savings"

⏱️  2:45-3:00 - CLOSING (Impact & Innovation)
----------------------------------------
VISUAL: Results dashboard with metrics

NARRATION:
"The Autonomous Incident Commander represents the future of incident 
response - true multi-agent autonomy with Byzantine consensus, predictive 
prevention, and zero-touch resolution. Built entirely on AWS with 
Bedrock AgentCore."

TEXT OVERLAYS:
- "Zero-Touch Resolution"
- "Byzantine Consensus"
- "Predictive Prevention"
- "Built on AWS Bedrock"

============================================================

🎥 RECORDING TIPS:
• Use 1920x1080 resolution
• Record at 30fps
• Keep cursor movements smooth
• Pause appropriately for text overlays
• Ensure clear audio throughout
• Have backup scenarios ready

🎬 POST-PRODUCTION:
• Add text overlays with consistent timing
• Include subtle background music (20% volume)
• Color correction if needed
• Export as 1080p MP4
• Upload to YouTube as public video
