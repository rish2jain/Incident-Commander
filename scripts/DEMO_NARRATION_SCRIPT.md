## 🎬 PHASE-BY-PHASE NARRATION

### **Phase 1: Introduction (0:00-0:20) — 20 seconds**

**Timing:** Narrate while showing Operations Dashboard

> "The Autonomous Incident Commander uses **five specialized AI agents** working through Byzantine consensus to resolve production incidents in **under three minutes**—**ninety-five percent faster** than traditional approaches, saving **two-point-eight million dollars annually**."

**Word count:** 35 words
**Pacing:** Moderate, emphasize bold numbers
**Pause:** 1 second after "annually" before next phase

---

### **Phase 2: Incident Trigger (0:20-0:35) — 15 seconds**

**Timing:** Narrate while clicking Database Cascade button

> "Watch as we trigger a database connection pool exhaustion incident—the kind that would normally cascade across microservices, affecting **twenty-five thousand users** and costing **one hundred sixty-eight thousand dollars** in downtime."

## 💡 RECORDING TIPS

**Voice Warm-up (5 minutes before recording):**
1. Hum gently to warm up vocal cords
2. Practice tongue twisters: "Red leather yellow leather" × 5
3. Breathe deeply and relax shoulders
4. Read the script aloud once at normal volume

**During Recording:**
- **Posture:** Sit up straight, shoulders relaxed
- **Breathing:** Breathe through nose, exhale through mouth
- **Microphone distance:** 6-8 inches, slightly off-axis
- **Volume:** Speak at 70-80% of normal conversation volume
- **Pacing:** Read slower than you think (you'll sound normal)

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- ❌ Speaking too fast (nervous energy)
- ❌ Inconsistent volume (moving towards/away from mic)
- ❌ Mouth noises (drink water beforehand)
- ❌ Reading monotone (vary inflection slightly)
- ❌ Over-enunciating (sounds unnatural)

## 🚀 ALTERNATIVE: AI VOICE GENERATION

If you prefer AI-generated voice:

**ElevenLabs (Recommended):**
- Website: elevenlabs.io
- Cost: $5/month for basic plan
- Voice: Choose "Adam" (professional male) or "Rachel" (professional female)
- Settings: Stability 75%, Clarity 75%
- Upload this script, generate, download WAV

**Google Cloud Text-to-Speech:**
- Free tier: 1 million characters/month
- Voice: en-US-Neural2-D (male) or en-US-Neural2-F (female)
- Speaking rate: 1.0 (normal)
- Pitch: 0 (neutral)

**Pros of AI:**
- Perfect consistency
- Zero background noise
- Can regenerate if timing needs adjustment
- Professional quality guaranteed

**Cons of AI:**
- Less human warmth
- May sound slightly robotic
- Lacks natural emphasis on key points

**Recommendation:** Use human voice if possible (more authentic), AI voice if time-constrained.

## 📝 SCRIPT TIMING VALIDATION

To verify timing matches video:

1. **Record yourself reading at comfortable pace**
2. **Check duration:** Should be 125-135 seconds total
3. **If too long (>135s):** Increase pace slightly, reduce pauses
4. **If too short (<125s):** Add 1-2 second pauses between phases
5. **Re-record until timing matches video within ±5 seconds**

**Phase-by-Phase Timing Check:**
- Phase 1 complete by: 0:20 ✓
- Phase 2 complete by: 0:35 ✓
- Phase 3 complete by: 1:20 ✓
- Phase 4 complete by: 1:45 ✓
- Phase 5 complete by: 1:55 ✓
- Phase 6 complete by: 2:08 ✓
